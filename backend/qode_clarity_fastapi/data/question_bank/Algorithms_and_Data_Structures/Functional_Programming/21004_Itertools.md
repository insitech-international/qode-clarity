# Problem Description

Imagine you're a data analyst working for a market research firm. Your team is tasked with analyzing large datasets containing information about customer preferences, product sales, and market trends. The datasets are too large to fit into memory, and processing them efficiently is crucial to deliver timely insights to your clients.

To tackle this challenge, you decide to leverage the itertools module in Python. Itertools provides a collection of powerful tools for working with iterators, allowing you to:

1. Generate infinite sequences and iterators for efficient data processing.
2. Create combinatorial iterators to explore different combinations and permutations of data.
3. Implement lazy evaluation to process data on-the-fly without loading everything into memory.
4. Compose and transform iterators to perform complex data manipulations.

Your goal is to utilize itertools effectively to process and analyze the large datasets, extract meaningful insights, and optimize the performance of your data processing pipelines. By mastering itertools, you can write more efficient, memory-friendly, and scalable code that can handle even the most demanding data analysis tasks.

# Versions

## Version 1: Infinite Sequence Generation

Suppose you need to generate an infinite sequence of numbers based on a specific pattern or formula. Utilize itertools to create custom infinite iterators that efficiently generate the required sequence on-the-fly. Explore how infinite iterators can be used to process data in a streaming fashion, without the need to store the entire sequence in memory.

## Version 2: Combinatorial Iterators

In your analysis, you often need to explore different combinations and permutations of data points to identify patterns and relationships. Leverage itertools to generate combinatorial iterators that produce all possible combinations, permutations, or cartesian products of the data. Investigate how combinatorial iterators can help you uncover insights and test hypotheses efficiently.

## Version 3: Iterator Composition and Transformation

Your data processing pipeline involves multiple stages of filtering, mapping, and reducing data. Use itertools to compose and transform iterators, allowing you to chain together multiple operations in a concise and readable manner. Explore how iterator composition can simplify complex data transformations and enable lazy evaluation for improved performance.

## Version 4: Data Grouping and Aggregation

Your analysis requires grouping and aggregating data based on specific criteria to derive meaningful summaries and statistics. Utilize itertools in combination with other Python tools to efficiently group and aggregate large datasets. Investigate how itertools can be used to split data into groups, apply aggregation functions, and generate summary statistics on-the-fly.
