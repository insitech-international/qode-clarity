# Problem Description

Imagine you're managing a dynamic schedule where you need to insert new tasks or events into an existing timeline. You have a set of pre-scheduled activities, and now you want to add a new activity that might overlap with some of the existing ones. Your task is to insert this new activity at the right place in the schedule, considering the timing of the existing activities.

This problem is about inserting a new element into a sequence of time-based events while maintaining the integrity of the existing schedule. It's similar to updating a calendar, adding a new task to a project timeline, or integrating a new workflow into an existing business process.

### Versions

## Version 1: Dynamic Scheduling

Insert a new interval into a given list of non-overlapping intervals such that the result has the same number of intervals. Return the inserted interval too.

Example 1:
Input: intervals = [[1,3]], newInterval = [2,5]
Output: [[1,5]]

Example 2:
Input: intervals = [ [0,30],[5,10],[15,20] ], newInterval = [2,7]
Output: [[0,30],[5,10]]

## Version 2: Real-Life Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Project Management

You're managing a software development project with multiple milestones. You receive a new feature request that spans across several existing milestones. Determine how to integrate this new feature into the project timeline without disrupting the current progress.

### Scenario 2: Resource Allocation

In a hospital setting, you have a schedule of ongoing treatments and surgeries. A new patient arrives who requires treatment that partially overlaps with some existing treatments. Decide where to fit this new case into the existing schedule.

### Scenario 3: Workflow Integration

You're implementing a new business process that intersects with several existing processes. Determine how to incorporate this new process into the existing workflow without causing disruptions.

For all scenarios, create an algorithm that inserts a new interval into a list of non-overlapping intervals.

Example 1:
Input: intervals = [[1,3]], newInterval = [2,5]
Output: [[1,5]]

Example 2:
Input: intervals = [ [0,30],[5,10],[15,20] ], newInterval = [2,7]
Output: [[0,30],[5,10]]

# Constraints

- The input list of intervals is initially sorted by start time.
- The input list of intervals and the newInterval will not have overlapping start or end times.
- The input list of intervals is guaranteed to have at least one element (non-empty).

# Notes

This problem demonstrates the application of insertion and merging techniques to interval-related problems. The key steps involve:

1. Finding the correct position to insert the new interval.
2. Merging the new interval with any adjacent intervals that would be split.
3. Returning the updated list of intervals.

Key concepts involved:
- Interval insertion
- Merging logic
- Time complexity optimization

The optimal solution typically involves finding the insertion point (O(n)) and then potentially merging intervals (O(k)), resulting in an overall time complexity of O(n + k), where n is the number of intervals and k is the number of intervals that need to be merged.

Understanding this problem helps in developing efficient algorithms for dynamic scheduling, resource allocation, and workflow optimization in various domains where dealing with time-based events and integrating new elements into existing structures is common.```
