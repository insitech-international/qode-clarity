## Problem Description

The Sqrt(x) problem involves implementing an efficient algorithm to calculate the square root of a given non-negative integer x. The challenge lies in achieving high accuracy while handling a wide range of input values, often with constraints on the use of built-in exponential and root functions.

## Versions

### Version 1: Integer Square Root

Implement a function to compute the integer square root of a non-negative integer x. The integer square root is the largest integer y such that y^2 <= x.

Example:
- Input: x = 26
- Output: 5
- Explanation: The square root of 26 is 5.09901... so 5 is returned.

Constraints:
- 0 <= x <= 2^31 - 1

Implementation Notes:
- Consider using binary search for an efficient solution.
- Be careful with potential integer overflow when calculating squares.

### Version 2: High-Precision Square Root

Extend the previous algorithm to compute the square root of x to a specified precision.

Example:
- Input: x = 2, precision = 1e-6
- Output: 1.414213
- Explanation: The square root of 2 calculated to 6 decimal places.

Constraints:
- 0 <= x <= 10^9
- 1e-12 <= precision <= 1e-1

Implementation Notes:
- Consider using Newton's method for faster convergence.
- Implement a mechanism to determine when the desired precision is achieved.

### Version 3: Square Root of Complex Numbers

Implement an algorithm to compute the square root of a complex number.

Example:
- Input: 1 + 2i
- Output: 1.272019 + 0.786151i

Constraints:
- -100 <= Re(z), Im(z) <= 100, where z is the input complex number

Implementation Notes:
- Use the formula: sqrt(a + bi) = sqrt((sqrt(a^2 + b^2) + a)/2) + i * sign(b) * sqrt((sqrt(a^2 + b^2) - a)/2)
- Be careful with special cases like pure imaginary numbers.

### Version 4: Real-Life Applications

#### Scenario 1: Computer Graphics - Ray Tracing

Develop a function for a ray tracing engine that efficiently calculates the intersection of a ray with a sphere. This involves solving a quadratic equation and requires fast, accurate square root calculations.

Input:
- Ray origin and direction
- Sphere center and radius

Output: 
- Distance to intersection point(s), if any

Implementation Notes:
- Optimize for speed, as this function will be called millions of times in a typical render.
- Consider using SIMD instructions for parallel computation of multiple rays.

#### Scenario 2: Machine Learning - Gradient Descent Optimization

Implement an adaptive learning rate algorithm for gradient descent that uses the root mean square (RMS) of past gradients. This requires efficient calculation of square roots for potentially large datasets.

Input:
- Current parameter values
- Gradient history

Output:
- Updated parameter values

Implementation Notes:
- Implement a running calculation of RMS to avoid storing all past gradients.
- Consider using approximations for sqrt in performance-critical inner loops.

#### Scenario 3: Finance - Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model

Develop a function to price European options using the Black-Scholes model. This requires calculating cumulative normal distribution, which involves error function (erf) calculations, often implemented using square roots.

Input:
- Option parameters (strike price, time to expiration, etc.)
- Current stock price
- Risk-free rate
- Stock volatility

Output:
- Option price

Implementation Notes:
- Implement an efficient approximation of the cumulative normal distribution.
- Consider using look-up tables for common values to speed up calculations.

#### Scenario 4: Signal Processing - RMS Amplitude Calculation

Create a real-time system to calculate the RMS amplitude of an audio signal. This requires efficient square root calculations on streaming data.

Input:
- Continuous stream of audio samples

Output:
- Real-time RMS amplitude

Implementation Notes:
- Implement a sliding window approach for real-time processing.
- Optimize for low latency, considering hardware-specific optimizations if applicable.

## Notes

- The square root function is a fundamental operation in many computational tasks. An efficient and accurate implementation is crucial for performance in various applications.
- When implementing square root algorithms, always consider the trade-off between speed and accuracy. In some applications, fast approximations may be preferable to slow, highly accurate calculations.
- Be aware of potential numerical instability, especially when dealing with very small or very large numbers. Consider using scaled arithmetic or other techniques to maintain accuracy across a wide range of inputs.
- For integer square root calculations, binary search or Newton's method are common choices. Each has its strengths depending on the specific requirements of the problem.
- In real-world applications, it's often beneficial to use platform-specific optimizations. Many modern CPUs have built-in square root instructions that can be significantly faster than software implementations.
- For complex number square roots, be particularly careful about branch cuts and ensuring continuity of the function across the complex plane.
- In scenarios requiring repeated square root calculations, consider precomputing common values or using approximation techniques like Taylor series expansions for small ranges.

Understanding and implementing efficient square root algorithms provides insights into numerical methods and opens up possibilities for optimizing a wide range of computational tasks across various domains.
