## Problem Description

Matrix Exponentiation is a powerful technique used to solve a wide range of problems, particularly those involving linear recurrence relations. The core idea is to represent a recurrence relation as a matrix equation and then use fast exponentiation to calculate high powers of the matrix efficiently.

Given a square matrix A and a positive integer n, the goal is to compute A^n efficiently. This technique can be used to solve problems that might otherwise require O(n) time in just O(log n) time.

## Versions

### Version 1: Basic Matrix Exponentiation

Implement the basic Matrix Exponentiation algorithm to calculate A^n mod m.

Example:

- Input:
  A = [[1, 1], [1, 0]], n = 10, m = 1000000007
- Output:
  [[89, 55], [55, 34]]
- Explanation: This is the 10th power of the Fibonacci matrix mod 1000000007.

Constraints:

- 1 <= matrix size <= 100
- 0 <= matrix elements < m
- 1 <= n <= 10^9
- 1 <= m <= 10^9

Implementation Notes:

- Implement matrix multiplication with modular arithmetic.
- Use the binary exponentiation technique to compute the power efficiently.
- Be careful about the order of matrix multiplication (it's not commutative).

### Version 2: Solving Linear Recurrences

Use Matrix Exponentiation to solve linear recurrence relations efficiently. Given a recurrence relation and initial values, find the nth term of the sequence.

Example (Fibonacci Sequence):

- Recurrence: F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
- Initial Values: F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
- Find: F(1000000000) mod 1000000007

Input: n = 1000000000, m = 1000000007
Output: 517691607
Explanation: This is the 1,000,000,000th Fibonacci number modulo 1000000007.

Constraints:

- 1 <= n <= 10^18
- 1 <= m <= 10^9

Implementation Notes:

- Construct the transformation matrix based on the recurrence relation.
- Handle very large values of n using appropriate data types or custom implementations.

### Version 3: K-th Path in a Graph

Given a directed graph with N nodes, calculate the number of paths of exactly K edges from node S to node E.

Example:

- Input:
  N = 4 (nodes numbered 0 to 3)
  Edges = [(0,1), (1,2), (2,3), (3,1), (1,3)]
  S = 0, E = 3, K = 5
- Output: 2
- Explanation: There are two paths of length 5 from node 0 to node 3:
  0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> 3
  0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3

Constraints:

- 1 <= N <= 100
- 0 <= S, E < N
- 1 <= K <= 10^9

Implementation Notes:

- Represent the graph as an adjacency matrix.
- The Kth power of this matrix gives the number of K-length paths between any two nodes.
- Use matrix exponentiation to efficiently compute the Kth power.

### Version 4: Dynamic System Evolution

Model the evolution of a dynamic system over time using Matrix Exponentiation. Given initial state variables and transition rules, predict the state after n time steps.

Example (Predator-Prey Model):

- State variables: x (prey population), y (predator population)
- Transition rules:
  x(t+1) = 1.1x(t) - 0.2y(t)
  y(t+1) = 0.9y(t) + 0.1x(t)
- Initial state: x(0) = 100, y(0) = 20
- Predict state after 1000 time steps

Input:

- Initial state: [100, 20]
- Transition matrix: [[1.1, -0.2], [0.1, 0.9]]
- n = 1000

Output: [x(1000), y(1000)]

Constraints:

- Matrix size determined by number of state variables
- 1 <= n <= 10^9
- All calculations done with double precision

Implementation Notes:

- Represent the system as a matrix equation.
- Use matrix exponentiation to efficiently compute the state after n steps.
- Be mindful of floating-point precision issues for large n.

### Version 5: Real-Life Applications

Input:

- Initial investment: $10,000
- Interest rates for next 5 years: [5%, 4%, 6%, 3%, 5%]
- Time horizon: 20 years (assume the 5-year pattern repeats)

Output: Final investment value

Implementation Notes:

#### Scenario 3: Quantum Circuit Simulation

Simulate the behavior of a quantum circuit over multiple time steps. Given a set of quantum gates and their sequence, calculate the final state of the quantum system after n applications of the circuit.

Input:

- Initial quantum state: [1, 0, 0, 0] (representing |00âŸ© in a two-qubit system)
- Quantum circuit: Hadamard gate on first qubit, then CNOT gate
- Number of repetitions: 1000

Output: Final quantum state

Implementation Notes:

- Represent quantum gates as unitary matrices.
- Combine gates to form a single circuit transformation matrix.
- Use matrix exponentiation to efficiently compute the effect of multiple applications.

#### Scenario 4: Transportation Network Analysis

Analyze the flow of traffic in a city's transportation network. Given a matrix representing the probabilities of moving between different areas of the city in one time step, predict the distribution of traffic after n time steps.

Input:

- Initial traffic distribution: [0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1] (for a 4-zone city)
- Transition matrix representing movement probabilities between zones
- Number of time steps: 1000

Output: Traffic distribution after 1000 time steps

Implementation Notes:

- The transition matrix represents a Markov chain.

## Notes

- Matrix Exponentiation is a powerful technique that can transform many O(n) algorithms into O(log n) algorithms, especially for problems involving linear recurrences or state transitions.
- When implementing Matrix Exponentiation, always be mindful of the modulus operation to prevent integer overflow. Apply the modulus after each matrix multiplication.
- For problems involving floating-point numbers (like in the dynamic system evolution), be aware of accumulating round-off errors. Consider using libraries for arbitrary-precision arithmetic if high precision is required for large n.
- In many real-world applications, the matrices involved may be sparse. Consider using sparse matrix representations and algorithms for improved efficiency in such cases.
- Matrix Exponentiation can be generalized to other algebraic structures, not just numerical matrices. For example, it can be applied to permutation groups or boolean matrices.
- When solving problems, always look for opportunities to formulate the problem in terms of matrix operations. Many problems that seem unrelated at first glance can be solved efficiently using this technique.

Understanding and mastering Matrix Exponentiation opens up a wide range of problem-solving possibilities, from theoretical computer science to practical real-world applications in various fields.
