# Problem Description

A B-tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time. It is optimized for systems that read and write large blocks of data, particularly in database and file systems where minimizing disk I/O operations is crucial.

# Versions

## Version 1: Basic B-Tree Operations

Implement a B-tree with the following operations:
1. Insertion
2. Deletion
3. Search
4. Range query

Ensure that the tree maintains its properties after each operation, including the requirement that all leaf nodes are at the same depth.

Example:

- Input: Insert 3, 7, 9, 23, 45, 1, 5, 14 into a B-tree of order 3
- Output: A valid B-tree structure
- Explanation: The resulting tree should have all properties of a B-tree maintained.

## Version 2: B-Tree for Database Indexing

Extend the basic B-tree to support database indexing operations:
1. Bulk loading: Efficiently build a B-tree from a large sorted dataset.
2. Crash recovery: Implement a mechanism to recover the B-tree structure after a system crash.
3. Concurrent access: Allow multiple threads to perform read and write operations simultaneously.

Example:

- Input: A dataset of 1 million sorted key-value pairs to be bulk loaded into a B-tree
- Output: A balanced B-tree index structure
- Explanation: The bulk loading should be more efficient than inserting elements one by one.

## Version 3: Real-Life Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Large-Scale Database System**:
You're designing the indexing structure for a distributed database system that handles petabytes of data across multiple nodes. The system needs to support high-throughput read and write operations, as well as efficient range queries.

a) How would you design a B-tree-based index that can scale across multiple nodes while maintaining consistency?
b) What modifications to the standard B-tree algorithm would you propose to optimize for SSD storage, considering the unique characteristics of SSDs compared to traditional HDDs?
c) How would you implement a versioning system within your B-tree structure to support multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) for the database?
d) Design a mechanism for efficiently handling "hot" keys (frequently accessed keys) in your distributed B-tree index to prevent bottlenecks and ensure even distribution of load across nodes.

**Scenario 2: File System Implementation**:
You're tasked with designing a new file system for a high-performance computing environment that needs to handle millions of files across a distributed storage system.

a) How would you use B-trees to implement the directory structure of this file system? Consider the challenges of handling deeply nested directories and large directories with millions of files.
b) Design a mechanism for efficient file name lookup in your B-tree-based directory structure, taking into account the need for case-insensitive and possibly language-specific sorting.
c) How would you modify the B-tree structure to support file system-specific operations like moving or renaming entire directories, which might involve large subtrees?
d) Implement a strategy for handling file system quotas (per-user or per-group storage limits) using your B-tree structure. How would you efficiently track and update storage usage?

**Scenario 3: Search Engine Indexing**:
You're building a search engine that needs to index billions of web pages and provide fast, relevant results for user queries.

a) Design a B-tree-based inverted index structure that can efficiently handle the scale of web search. How would you deal with updates to the index as web pages change?
b) Implement a mechanism for handling phrase queries (exact matches of multiple words in order) using your B-tree index structure. Consider the trade-offs between index size and query performance.
c) How would you modify your B-tree structure to support "fuzzy" search, allowing for slight misspellings or variations in search terms?
d) Design a system for efficiently updating page rankings within your B-tree index structure. How would you handle the need to frequently update rankings while maintaining good query performance?

For all scenarios, consider the specific challenges of working with very large datasets, the need for high concurrency, and the importance of minimizing I/O operations. Your solutions should be scalable, fault-tolerant, and optimized for real-world performance.

  - Search engine: billions of web pages, update frequency in real-time

# Notes

- B-trees are optimized for systems that read and write large blocks of data, making them ideal for database systems and file systems.
- When implementing B-trees, consider the trade-offs between node size, tree height, and I/O operations.
- In distributed systems, special care must be taken to maintain consistency across nodes while allowing for high concurrency.
- For SSDs, consider optimizing for their specific characteristics, such as fast random reads and the need to minimize write amplification.
- In real-world implementations, consider using techniques like buffer management, lazy propagation of updates, and batch processing to improve performance.
- When dealing with very large datasets, memory management and efficient serialization/deserialization of tree nodes become crucial considerations.
