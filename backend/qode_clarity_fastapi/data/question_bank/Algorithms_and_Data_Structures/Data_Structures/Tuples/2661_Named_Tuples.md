# Constraints

- Solutions should be memory-efficient, capable of handling large datasets (up to 10^6 elements).
- Named tuples should be used effectively to improve code readability and maintain immutability where appropriate.
- Performance should be considered, especially for operations that may be called frequently.
- The system should be designed with extensibility in mind, allowing for easy addition of new features or data types.
- Error handling should be robust, with clear messages for invalid operations or data.

# Notes

- Consider using the `collections.namedtuple` factory function for creating named tuples.
- For performance-critical operations, consider using `__slots__` with custom classes as an alternative to named tuples.
- When working with large datasets, consider using generators and itertools to reduce memory usage.
- For scientific computing, consider integration with libraries like NumPy for improved performance.
- In financial modeling, be aware of the limitations of floating-point arithmetic and consider using the `decimal` module for precise calculations.
- For game development, consider the trade-offs between using named tuples and more complex game engine architectures.
- In system monitoring, consider the performance implications of logging and implement appropriate filtering and sampling techniques.
- For bioinformatics applications, consider integrating with specialized libraries like Biopython for advanced functionality.
