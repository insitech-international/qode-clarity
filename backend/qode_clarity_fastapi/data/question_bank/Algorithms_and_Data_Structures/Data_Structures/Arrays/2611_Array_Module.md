# Problem Description

Design and implement an advanced Array module that supports various complex operations and optimizations. The module should be efficient for large datasets and support both static and dynamic scenarios.

# Versions

## Version 1: Basic Array Operations with Optimization

Implement an Array class with the following optimized operations:
1. `insert(index, value)`: Insert a value at a specific index.
2. `delete(index)`: Delete the value at a specific index.
3. `max_subarray_sum()`: Find the maximum subarray sum (Kadane's algorithm).
4. `sliding_window_maximum(k)`: Find maximum values in sliding windows of size k.
5. `running_median()`: Maintain the running median of the array.

Example:
```python
arr = Array([1, 3, -1, -3, 5, 3, 6, 7])
arr.insert(2, 4)
print(arr.max_subarray_sum())  # Output: 22
print(arr.sliding_window_maximum(3))  # Output: [4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 7]
print(arr.running_median())  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 3.5, 4, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5]
```

## Version 2: Advanced Array Transformations

Extend the Array class with more advanced operations:
1. `partition(predicate)`: Partition the array based on a given predicate.
2. `custom_sort(comparator)`: Sort the array using a custom comparator.
3. `segment_tree()`: Create a segment tree for range queries.
4. `sparse_table()`: Create a sparse table for efficient range queries.
5. `polynomial_rolling_hash()`: Compute polynomial rolling hash for subarrays.

Example:
```python
arr = Array([3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5])
arr.partition(lambda x: x % 2 == 0)
print(arr)  # Output: [4, 2, 6, 3, 1, 1, 5, 9, 5, 3, 5]
arr.custom_sort(lambda a, b: b - a)
print(arr)  # Output: [9, 6, 5, 5, 5, 4, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1]
segment_tree = arr.segment_tree()
print(segment_tree.range_sum(1, 5))  # Output: 25
```

## Version 3: Parallel and Distributed Array Operations

Implement parallel and distributed versions of array operations:
1. `parallel_map(function)`: Apply a function to each element in parallel.
2. `parallel_reduce(function)`: Perform a reduction operation in parallel.
3. `distribute(num_partitions)`: Distribute the array across multiple partitions.
4. `collect()`: Collect distributed partitions back into a single array.
5. `parallel_sort()`: Perform parallel sorting (e.g., parallel merge sort).

Example:
```python
arr = Array(range(1000000))
squared = arr.parallel_map(lambda x: x**2)
sum_squares = squared.parallel_reduce(lambda x, y: x + y)
print(sum_squares)  # Output: 333332833333500000

distributed_arr = arr.distribute(4)
sorted_arr = distributed_arr.parallel_sort().collect()
print(sorted_arr[:10])  # Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

## Version 4: Streaming and Online Array Algorithms

Design an array module for streaming and online scenarios:
1. `reservoir_sampling(k)`: Perform reservoir sampling on a stream of data.
2. `online_median()`: Maintain the median in an online fashion.
3. `count_min_sketch()`: Implement a count-min sketch for frequency estimation.
4. `bloom_filter()`: Implement a Bloom filter for membership testing.
5. `hyperloglog()`: Implement HyperLogLog for cardinality estimation.

Example:
```python
stream = StreamingArray()
for i in range(1000000):
    stream.append(random.randint(1, 100))

sample = stream.reservoir_sampling(100)
print(len(sample))  # Output: 100

print(stream.online_median())  # Output: ~50 (approximate median)

sketch = stream.count_min_sketch()
print(sketch.estimate_frequency(42))  # Output: Estimated frequency of 42

bloom = stream.bloom_filter()
print(bloom.might_contain(42))  # Output: True or False

hll = stream.hyperloglog()
print(hll.estimate_cardinality())  # Output: ~100 (approximate distinct count)
```
