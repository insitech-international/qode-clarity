# Problem Description

String formatting is a crucial skill in programming, with applications ranging from simple data presentation to complex report generation. This problem set explores various advanced string formatting techniques and their real-world applications across different domains.

# Versions

## Version 1: Financial Reporting System

Design a financial reporting system that generates formatted reports for various financial instruments and transactions. The system should handle:

1. Currency formatting with proper decimal places and thousand separators
2. Percentage formatting for growth rates and ratios
3. Table formatting for balance sheets and income statements
4. Date formatting for fiscal periods and transaction dates
5. Number scaling (e.g., millions, billions) for large financial figures

Real-life scenarios:
a) Generate a quarterly earnings report for a multinational corporation
b) Create a daily trading summary for a stock exchange
c) Produce a personal finance statement with budget categories and spending analysis
d) Format investment portfolio performance with annualized returns and risk metrics

## Version 2: Scientific Data Representation

Implement a scientific data representation system that formats and displays data from various scientific domains. The system should support:

1. Scientific notation for very large or small numbers
2. Unit conversions and formatting (e.g., SI units)
3. Error margin representation (e.g., 5.67 Â± 0.23)
4. Matrix and vector formatting
5. Chemical formula formatting
6. Genetic sequence formatting

Real-life scenarios:
a) Display results from a particle physics experiment
b) Format climate model predictions with confidence intervals
c) Represent chemical reactions and molecular structures
d) Present genomic data analysis results
e) Format astronomical distances and scales

## Version 3: Internationalization and Localization

Create a string formatting system that handles internationalization and localization challenges. The system should address:

1. Multi-language support with placeholders for translated strings
2. Right-to-left (RTL) text formatting for languages like Arabic and Hebrew
3. Date and time formatting according to different cultural norms
4. Number formatting with different decimal and thousand separators
5. Currency formatting for different regions
6. Handling of cultural-specific formats (e.g., Chinese numerals, Indian numbering system)

Real-life scenarios:
a) Localize a e-commerce website for multiple countries
b) Format a multi-language user manual for a consumer electronics device
c) Create a travel app that displays local time, currency, and cultural information
d) Develop a global weather app with localized temperature and measurement units

## Version 4: Code Generation and Documentation

Develop a string formatting system for code generation and documentation. The system should handle:

1. Proper indentation and code block formatting
2. Syntax highlighting placeholders
3. Comment formatting and alignment
4. Function and class signature formatting
5. Docstring generation with parameter and return value descriptions
6. URL and filepath formatting

Real-life scenarios:
a) Generate API documentation from code comments
b) Create a code prettifier for multiple programming languages
c) Develop a template engine for generating boilerplate code
d) Build a markdown to HTML converter with code block formatting

## Version 5: Data Visualization Text Formatting

Implement a text formatting system for data visualization contexts. The system should support:

1. Axis label formatting with scientific notation and unit abbreviations
2. Legend entry formatting with color codes and descriptions
3. Annotation text formatting with positioning and alignment
4. Tick label formatting for various scales (linear, logarithmic, time-based)
5. Heatmap cell value formatting
6. Formatting of statistical information (p-values, confidence intervals) in plot titles and captions

Real-life scenarios:
a) Create formatted labels for a complex multi-axis plot in a scientific paper
b) Generate legend entries for a color-coded geographical map
c) Format annotations for a financial candlestick chart
d) Produce formatted tick labels for a logarithmic scale in a population growth chart

## Version 6: Natural Language Processing Output Formatting

Design a formatting system for presenting natural language processing (NLP) results. The system should handle:

1. Formatting parsed sentence structures (e.g., syntax trees)
2. Highlighting named entities in text
3. Presenting word embeddings and similarity scores
4. Formatting sentiment analysis results with color coding
5. Displaying machine translation results with original and translated text alignment
6. Formatting chatbot responses with conversation history

Real-life scenarios:
a) Present the results of a sentiment analysis on customer reviews
b) Display the output of a named entity recognition system for news articles
c) Format the results of a text classification algorithm for document categorization
d) Present machine translation results with confidence scores and alternative translations

# Constraints

- The system should be able to handle Unicode characters and special symbols.
- Performance should be considered for large-scale formatting tasks (e.g., generating reports with thousands of entries).
- Memory efficiency should be taken into account, especially when dealing with large datasets or long strings.
- The formatting system should be extensible to accommodate new formats and requirements.
- Error handling should be robust, with clear messages for incorrect format specifications.

# Notes

- Consider using libraries like `babel` for complex internationalization tasks.
- For scientific formatting, the `uncertainties` package can be useful for handling error propagation and formatting.
- In code generation scenarios, consider using abstract syntax trees (AST) for more robust code manipulation.
- For data visualization text formatting, integration with popular libraries like matplotlib or plotly might be necessary.
- In NLP scenarios, consider integrating with NLP libraries like NLTK or spaCy for more advanced formatting options.
- Always consider the target audience and the context in which the formatted strings will be used (e.g., print vs. web display).
- For complex formatting tasks, consider implementing a domain-specific language (DSL) for format specifications.
