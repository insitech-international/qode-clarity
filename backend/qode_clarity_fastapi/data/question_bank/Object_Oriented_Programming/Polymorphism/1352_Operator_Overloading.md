# Problem Description

Operator overloading is a feature in certain programming languages that allows custom implementations of operators for user-defined types. This problem set explores various aspects and applications of operator overloading, challenging you to design and implement classes that effectively utilize this concept to create intuitive and expressive interfaces for complex objects.

# Versions

## Version 1: Basic Arithmetic Operator Overloading

Create a `Complex` number class that overloads the basic arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) to perform complex number arithmetic.

Questions to consider:

1. How do you ensure that the overloaded operators maintain the expected behavior (e.g., commutativity, associativity)?
2. What are the differences between overloading unary and binary operators?
3. How would you handle division by zero in the context of complex numbers?

## Version 2: Comparison Operator Overloading

Implement a `FractionalNumber` class that represents fractions and overloads comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`) to allow direct comparison between fractions.

Questions to consider:

1. How do you ensure that the overloaded comparison operators maintain transitivity?
2. What challenges might you face when comparing fractions with different denominators?
3. How would you handle comparisons between a `FractionalNumber` object and other numeric types (e.g., integers, floating-point numbers)?

## Version 3: Assignment and Compound Assignment Operators

Extend the `Complex` number class to overload the assignment operator (`=`) and compound assignment operators (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`) for complex number arithmetic.

Questions to consider:

1. What are the key differences between overloading the assignment operator and other binary operators?
2. How do you ensure proper behavior when assigning a complex number to itself (self-assignment)?
3. What are the potential pitfalls of overloading the assignment operator, and how can you avoid them?

## Version 4: Indexing and Function Call Operators

Create a `Matrix` class that overloads the indexing operator (`[]`) for accessing elements and the function call operator (`()`) for matrix operations like transposition or inversion.

Questions to consider:

1. How would you implement multi-dimensional indexing (e.g., `matrix[i][j]`) using operator overloading?
2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using the function call operator for matrix operations instead of named methods?
3. How can you use operator overloading to implement lazy evaluation or caching for expensive matrix operations?

## Version 5: Real-Life Domain Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Financial Modeling

Design a `Money` class that represents monetary values with different currencies. Implement operator overloading to allow arithmetic operations between `Money` objects, handling currency conversions automatically.

Questions to consider:

1. How would you handle arithmetic operations between `Money` objects with different currencies?
2. What challenges might you face when implementing comparison operators for `Money` objects with different currencies?
3. How can you use operator overloading to implement currency exchange rate updates efficiently?

### Scenario 2: 3D Graphics Engine

Create a `Vector3D` class for a 3D graphics engine, overloading operators for vector arithmetic, dot product, cross product, and scalar multiplication.

Questions to consider:

1. How would you implement the cross product using operator overloading?
2. What are the performance implications of overloading operators for frequently used operations in a graphics engine?
3. How can you use operator overloading to implement more complex operations like vector projection or reflection?

### Scenario 3: Polynomial Algebra System

Implement a `Polynomial` class that represents mathematical polynomials, overloading operators for polynomial arithmetic, evaluation, and composition.

Questions to consider:

1. How would you handle polynomials of different degrees in arithmetic operations?
2. What challenges might you face when implementing the composition operator for polynomials?
3. How can you use operator overloading to implement operations like polynomial differentiation or integration?

### Scenario 4: Date and Time Library

Design a `DateTime` class that represents dates and times, overloading arithmetic and comparison operators for date/time calculations and comparisons.

Questions to consider:

1. How would you handle time zone conversions when performing arithmetic operations on `DateTime` objects?
2. What challenges might you face when implementing comparison operators that consider both date and time components?
3. How can you use operator overloading to implement operations like finding the difference between two dates in various units (days, weeks, months)?

### Scenario 5: Big Integer Library

Create a `BigInteger` class for arbitrary-precision integer arithmetic, overloading all relevant arithmetic, comparison, and bitwise operators.

Questions to consider:

1. How would you implement efficient algorithms for basic arithmetic operations on large integers?
2. What challenges might you face when overloading bitwise operators for arbitrary-precision integers?
3. How can you use operator overloading to implement more advanced operations like modular exponentiation or primality testing?

# Constraints

- Ensure that overloaded operators maintain the expected semantics and behavior of their built-in counterparts.
- Consider the performance implications of operator overloading, especially for frequently used operations.
- Be mindful of potential ambiguities or unexpected behavior that may arise from operator overloading.

# Notes

- Operator overloading can greatly enhance the readability and expressiveness of code when used appropriately, but it can also lead to confusion if overused or implemented counter-intuitively.
- Consider the principle of least astonishment when designing operator overloads: the behavior of overloaded operators should be intuitive and consistent with their conventional usage.
- Be aware that not all programming languages support operator overloading, and the extent of support can vary significantly between languages.
- Think about how you might implement similar functionality in languages that don't support operator overloading (e.g., using named methods).
- Consider the impact of operator overloading on code maintainability, especially when working in large teams or on long-term projects.
- Be cautious about overloading operators in ways that might lead to implicit type conversions or unexpected behavior.
- Think about how operator overloading interacts with other language features like type inference, function overloading, and template metaprogramming.
