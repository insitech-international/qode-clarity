# Problem Description

Imagine you're tasked with building a high-performance, real-time financial data processing system for a major stock exchange. This system needs to handle millions of transactions per second, process market data feeds, execute trades, and update multiple databases and caches simultaneously. Traditional synchronous programming models would struggle to meet the performance and scalability requirements of such a system.

This is where coroutines and AsyncIO come into play. Coroutines are special functions that can pause their execution and yield control to other coroutines, allowing for cooperative multitasking. AsyncIO is a library that provides infrastructure for writing single-threaded concurrent code using coroutines, multiplexing I/O access over sockets and other resources.

By mastering coroutines and AsyncIO, you can build highly concurrent and efficient systems that can handle massive amounts of I/O-bound operations, making them perfect for scenarios like our high-frequency trading platform.

# Versions

**Real Life Scenarios**

## Version 1: Real-time Market Data Processing

Implement a system to process real-time market data feeds from multiple sources. Use coroutines and AsyncIO to:

- Concurrently connect to and read from multiple data feeds
- Parse and normalize the incoming data
- Update an in-memory order book in real-time
- Broadcast updates to subscribed clients

## Version 2: High-Frequency Trading Engine

Develop a high-frequency trading engine that can execute trades based on market conditions. Use coroutines and AsyncIO to:

- Monitor market conditions across multiple exchanges
- Implement trading strategies as coroutines
- Execute trades concurrently on different exchanges
- Manage risk and exposure in real-time

## Version 3: Order Management System

Create an order management system that can handle a high volume of incoming orders. Implement coroutines and AsyncIO to:

- Process incoming orders concurrently
- Validate orders against current market conditions
- Route orders to appropriate exchanges or dark pools
- Provide real-time updates on order status to clients

## Version 4: Financial Data Analytics Pipeline

Develop a real-time analytics pipeline for financial data. Use coroutines and AsyncIO to:

- Ingest data from multiple sources concurrently
- Perform complex calculations and analytics on streaming data
- Update multiple databases and caches with processed results
- Generate and distribute real-time reports and alerts

# Constraints

1. Ensure all I/O operations are non-blocking
2. Implement proper error handling and recovery mechanisms
3. Optimize for low latency and high throughput
4. Ensure thread safety in concurrent operations
5. Implement proper logging and monitoring
6. Handle backpressure when consumers can't keep up with data producers
7. Ensure the system can scale horizontally
8. Implement proper resource management (e.g., database connections, network sockets)
9. Ensure compatibility with different versions of Python (3.7+)
10. Optimize memory usage, especially for long-running processes
11. Implement proper exception handling without crashing the entire system
12. Ensure the system can handle network partitions and reconnections gracefully
13. Implement proper data validation and sanitization
14. Optimize CPU usage for multi-core systems
15. Ensure compatibility with various asyncio event loops and third-party extensions

# Notes

Key points about Coroutines and AsyncIO:

- Coroutines are defined using the `async def` syntax in Python.
- Coroutines are executed using `await` or by passing them to `asyncio.run()`.
- AsyncIO provides an event loop that schedules and runs coroutines.
- `asyncio.gather()` can be used to run multiple coroutines concurrently.
- `asyncio.create_task()` creates a Task object that can be cancelled or monitored.
- Coroutines can be used with context managers using `async with`.
- AsyncIO provides primitives for synchronization like locks, events, and queues.
- `asyncio.run()` is used to run the top-level entry point for AsyncIO programs.
- Coroutines can be combined with generators using `yield` and `async for`.
- AsyncIO can be used with callback-based libraries using `loop.call_soon()` and similar methods.
- `asyncio.as_completed()` allows processing results as soon as they're available.
- Debugging AsyncIO programs can be challenging; use `asyncio.get_event_loop().set_debug(True)` for detailed logging.
- AsyncIO can be extended with third-party libraries like uvloop for improved performance.
- Coroutines should not use blocking calls; use `asyncio.to_thread()` for running synchronous code in a separate thread.
- AsyncIO works well with other async frameworks like aiohttp for HTTP clients and servers.

Remember, while coroutines and AsyncIO can greatly improve performance for I/O-bound tasks, they may not provide benefits for CPU-bound operations. Always profile your code to ensure you're getting the expected performance improvements.
