# Problem Description

Implement custom metaclasses in Python to control class creation and behavior. Understand how metaclasses can be used to modify class definitions, implement class decorators, and create powerful abstractions for framework development.

# Versions

## Version 1: HackerRank - Singleton Metaclass

Implement a metaclass that ensures only one instance of a class is created (Singleton pattern). The metaclass should work for any class it's applied to, maintaining a single instance across multiple instantiations.

## Version 2: HackerRank - Abstract Base Class Enforcer

Create a metaclass that enforces the implementation of abstract methods in derived classes. The metaclass should raise an error if a class inheriting from an abstract base class doesn't implement all required methods.

## Version 3: Real-Life Scenario - ORM Field Validator

Develop a metaclass for an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system that automatically validates field types and constraints when a model class is defined. The metaclass should ensure that field definitions adhere to specified rules (e.g., data types, length limits, required fields).

## Version 4: Real-Life Scenario - API Version Control

Implement a metaclass for an API framework that manages versioning of API endpoints. The metaclass should allow developers to define multiple versions of methods and automatically route requests to the appropriate version based on client specifications.

## Version 5: Real-Life Scenario - Aspect-Oriented Programming

Create a metaclass that implements aspect-oriented programming concepts. The metaclass should allow developers to define aspects (e.g., logging, transaction management) that can be automatically applied to methods of classes using the metaclass.

# Constraints

- For all versions:
  - Implement metaclasses using the appropriate syntax for Python 3 (`class MyMetaclass(type):`)
  - Ensure compatibility with inheritance hierarchies.
  - Consider performance implications, especially for metaclasses that perform complex operations during class creation.
  - Provide clear documentation for metaclasses, as they can make code harder to understand if not well-explained.

# Notes

- Metaclasses are defined by inheriting from `type` in Python 3.
- The `__new__` method of a metaclass is called to create the class object, while `__init__` is called to initialize it.
- Metaclasses can be specified using the `metaclass` keyword argument in the class definition.
- Consider using simpler alternatives (e.g., class decorators, descriptors) if they can achieve the same result with less complexity.
- Metaclasses are powerful but can lead to hard-to-debug code if overused. Use them judiciously for cases where class-level manipulation is necessary.
- Explore the `abc` module in Python for creating abstract base classes, which can sometimes be an alternative to custom metaclasses.
