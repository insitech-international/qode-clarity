# Problem Description

Implement and utilize metaclasses in combination with descriptors to create powerful and flexible class behaviors in Python. Understand how these advanced features can be used to control attribute access, implement computed properties, and create reusable patterns for class definitions.

# Versions

## Version 1: HackerRank - Type-Checked Properties

Implement a system using metaclasses and descriptors that enforces type checking for class attributes. The system should allow developers to specify expected types for attributes and raise errors if incompatible types are assigned.

## Version 2: HackerRank - Lazy Loaded Attributes

Create a metaclass and descriptor combination that implements lazy loading for expensive-to-compute class attributes. The attributes should only be calculated when first accessed and then cached for subsequent accesses.

## Version 3: Real-Life Scenario - Database ORM with Validation

Develop a metaclass and descriptor system for a database ORM that handles field definitions, data validation, and database column mappings. The system should allow developers to define model classes with field types, constraints, and database-specific options.

## Version 4: Real-Life Scenario - Configuration Management System

Implement a configuration management system using metaclasses and descriptors. The system should support loading configuration from various sources (e.g., files, environment variables, default values), type conversion, and validation of configuration options.

## Version 5: Real-Life Scenario - Event-Driven Programming Framework

Create an event-driven programming framework using metaclasses and descriptors. The framework should allow developers to define event handlers as methods, automatically register them with an event dispatcher, and manage event propagation and handling.

# Constraints

- For all versions:
  - Implement metaclasses using the appropriate syntax for Python 3 (`class MyMetaclass(type):`)
  - Implement descriptors using the descriptor protocol (`__get__`, `__set__`, `__delete__`)
  - Ensure proper interaction between metaclasses and descriptors.
  - Consider thread-safety for descriptors that manage shared state.
  - Provide clear error messages and debugging information for issues related to metaclass or descriptor behavior.

# Notes

- Metaclasses can be used to customize class creation and modification, while descriptors control attribute access at the instance level.
- The descriptor protocol consists of `__get__`, `__set__`, and `__delete__` methods. Implementing these methods gives you control over how attributes are accessed and modified.
- Data descriptors (those that define `__set__` or `__delete__`) take precedence over instance dictionaries.
- Consider using `__slots__` in combination with descriptors for more efficient memory usage in classes with a fixed set of attributes.
- Metaclasses can be used to automatically apply descriptors to class attributes based on certain criteria or decorators.
- While powerful, the combination of metaclasses and descriptors can lead to complex and hard-to-understand code. Use them judiciously and provide thorough documentation.
