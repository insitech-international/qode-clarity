# Problem Description

Imagine you're developing a sophisticated object-relational mapping (ORM) framework for a large-scale enterprise application. This framework needs to provide a clean and intuitive API for defining database models, while also handling complex behaviors like lazy loading, caching, and query optimization behind the scenes.

Non-data descriptors are a powerful feature in Python that can help you achieve this goal. They allow you to define how attribute access is handled at the class level, providing a way to implement computed attributes, method binding, and other advanced behaviors.

By mastering non-data descriptors, you can create a flexible and powerful ORM framework that provides a simple interface for developers while handling complex database operations transparently.

# Versions

**Real Life Scenarios**

## Version 1: Lazy Loading for ORM

Implement a non-data descriptor that enables lazy loading of related objects in your ORM. The descriptor should:

- Return a proxy object when accessed for the first time
- Load the actual data from the database only when needed
- Cache the loaded data for subsequent accesses

## Version 2: Method Binding for Model Instances

Create a non-data descriptor that implements method binding for your ORM models. This descriptor should:

- Allow defining methods at the class level that operate on instance data
- Bind these methods to instances when accessed
- Provide proper support for method chaining

## Version 3: Computed Attributes

Develop a non-data descriptor that enables computed attributes in your ORM models. This descriptor should:

- Allow defining attributes that are calculated based on other attributes
- Recalculate the value whenever dependent attributes change
- Provide caching options for expensive computations

## Version 4: Query Optimization Hints

Implement a non-data descriptor that allows developers to provide query optimization hints. This descriptor should:

- Allow specifying indexing and join strategies at the attribute level
- Influence the query generation process when the attribute is used in queries
- Provide a way to enable/disable these hints dynamically

# Constraints

1. Ensure compatibility with Python's attribute lookup rules
2. Implement proper support for inheritance and method resolution order
3. Handle edge cases like attribute deletion and `__getattribute__` interactions
4. Optimize for memory usage, especially for large numbers of instances
5. Ensure thread safety for descriptor operations
6. Implement proper error handling and informative error messages
7. Ensure compatibility with Python's data model and special methods
8. Optimize performance for frequent attribute access
9. Implement proper documentation and introspection support
10. Ensure compatibility with different versions of Python (3.6+)
11. Handle potential recursion in descriptor calls
12. Implement proper garbage collection and resource management
13. Ensure compatibility with Python's pickling mechanism
14. Optimize for both read and write operations on attributes
15. Implement proper support for metaclasses and class decorators

# Notes

Key points about Non-Data Descriptors:

- Non-data descriptors are objects that define `__get__` method but not `__set__` or `__delete__`.
- They are used to customize attribute access for classes and instances.
- Non-data descriptors are overridden by instance attributes with the same name.
- They are commonly used for implementing methods in Python.
- The `__get__` method receives the instance and owner class as arguments.
- Non-data descriptors can be used to implement computed attributes.
- They can be combined with metaclasses for more advanced customization.
- Non-data descriptors are resolved before looking up instance attributes.
- They can be used to implement class methods and static methods.
- The `property` built-in is an example of a data descriptor, not a non-data descriptor.
- Non-data descriptors can be used to implement attribute validation and transformation.
- They can be used to implement lazy attribute initialization.
- Non-data descriptors can be used to implement method binding for custom objects.
- They can be combined with `__getattribute__` for more complex attribute lookup logic.
- Non-data descriptors can be used to implement attribute aliases and redirections.

Remember, while non-data descriptors provide powerful customization options, they should be used judiciously to maintain code readability and avoid unnecessary complexity. Always consider whether simpler alternatives like properties or regular methods might suffice before reaching for non-data descriptors.
