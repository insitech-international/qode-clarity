# Problem Description

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a prevalent web security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This problem focuses on implementing various XSS prevention techniques to secure web applications against different types of XSS attacks.

# Versions

## Version 1: Input Validation and Output Encoding

Implement input validation and output encoding to prevent reflected and stored XSS attacks.

Example:
- Input: User-submitted content to be displayed on a web page
- Output: Describe the process of validating the input and encoding it for safe output in HTML, JavaScript, and URL contexts

## Version 2: Content Security Policy (CSP)

Implement a Content Security Policy to mitigate XSS attacks.

Example:
- Input: A web application with various content sources (scripts, styles, images)
- Output: Describe the process of creating and implementing an effective CSP

## Version 3: DOM-based XSS Prevention

Implement measures to prevent DOM-based XSS attacks in a single-page application.

Example:
- Input: A JavaScript function that dynamically updates the DOM based on user input
- Output: Describe the process of securing the function against DOM-based XSS

## Version 4: Real-Life Domain Cases

### Scenario 1: Social Media Platform

You're enhancing XSS protection for a social media platform with user-generated content.

Tasks:
a) Implement XSS protection for user posts and comments
b) Design a system for safely rendering user-provided HTML content
c) Implement XSS protection for user profiles and custom CSS
d) Design a mechanism to retrofit XSS protection to legacy parts of the application

### Scenario 2: Online Banking Dashboard

You're implementing XSS protection for an online banking dashboard with dynamic data display.

Tasks:
a) Implement XSS protection for displaying transaction history and account balances
b) Design a system for securely rendering charts and graphs with user data
c) Implement XSS protection for custom alerts and notifications
d) Design a mechanism to prevent XSS in exported financial reports (CSV, PDF)

### Scenario 3: E-commerce Product Reviews

You're building XSS protection for a product review system in an e-commerce platform.

Tasks:
a) Implement XSS protection for user-submitted reviews and ratings
b) Design a system for safely displaying product descriptions from various vendors
c) Implement XSS protection for user-generated Q&A sections
d) Design a mechanism to prevent XSS in product search functionality

### Scenario 4: Content Management System (CMS)

You're developing XSS protection for a CMS used by non-technical content creators.

Tasks:
a) Implement XSS protection for WYSIWYG editors
b) Design a system for safely embedding user-uploaded images and videos
c) Implement XSS protection for custom themes and templates
d) Design a mechanism to prevent XSS in dynamic widget functionality

### Scenario 5: Collaborative Document Editing Platform

You're implementing XSS protection for a real-time collaborative document editing platform.

Tasks:
a) Implement XSS protection for real-time content updates
b) Design a system for safely rendering different document formats (Markdown, LaTeX)
c) Implement XSS protection for collaborative commenting and annotation features
d) Design a mechanism to prevent XSS in document sharing and embedding functionality

# Constraints

- For all versions:
  - Implement XSS protection without significantly impacting application performance
  - Ensure protection mechanisms don't break legitimate functionality
  - Consider compatibility with various browsers and client-side frameworks

- For Version 4 (Real-Life Domain Cases):
  - Consider scalability for high-traffic applications
  - Ensure XSS protection works in conjunction with other security measures (e.g., CSP, CSRF protection)
  - Implement protection in compliance with relevant security standards (e.g., OWASP guidelines)

# Notes

- Use context-aware output encoding for different parts of the HTML document (body, attribute, JavaScript, CSS, URL)
- Implement proper input validation on the server-side; client-side validation can be bypassed
- Use secure libraries for HTML sanitization when allowing limited HTML input
- Implement Content Security Policy as an additional layer of defense against XSS
- Be cautious of sources of untrusted data, including URL parameters, form inputs, and data from databases or APIs
- Regularly update and patch all dependencies to address new vulnerabilities
- Implement proper error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information or create new XSS vectors
- Educate developers about XSS risks and secure coding practices
- Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify potential XSS vulnerabilities
- Stay informed about new XSS attack techniques and adjust protection mechanisms accordingly
