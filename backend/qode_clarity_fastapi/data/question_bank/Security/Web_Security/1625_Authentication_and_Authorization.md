# Problem Description

Authentication and authorization are fundamental aspects of security in any application. This problem focuses on implementing robust authentication mechanisms and fine-grained authorization controls.

# Versions

## Version 1: Basic Username/Password Authentication

Implement a secure username and password authentication system, including password hashing and salting.

Example:
- Input: Username and password from a login form
- Output: Describe the process of verifying credentials and creating a session

## Version 2: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Extend the authentication system to support multi-factor authentication using methods such as Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) or SMS codes.

Example:
- Input: Username, password, and a second factor (e.g., TOTP code)
- Output: Describe the process of validating both factors and granting access

## Version 3: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Implement a role-based access control system to manage permissions for different user types.

Example:
- Input: User roles (e.g., Admin, Editor, Viewer) and a set of permissions for each role
- Output: Describe how to implement and enforce these roles and permissions in an application

## Version 4: Real-Life Domain Cases

### Scenario 1: Enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO) System

You're tasked with implementing an SSO system for a large corporation with multiple internal applications.

Tasks:
a) Implement SAML-based SSO for web applications
b) Design a system for integrating legacy applications into the SSO ecosystem
c) Implement just-in-time (JIT) user provisioning for new applications
d) Design a secure logout mechanism that terminates sessions across all applications

### Scenario 2: Banking Application Security

You're developing authentication and authorization for a mobile banking application.

Tasks:
a) Implement biometric authentication (fingerprint, face recognition) for the mobile app
b) Design a system for secure transaction authorization with dynamic security challenges
c) Implement a risk-based authentication system that adapts based on user behavior and location
d) Design a mechanism for temporary account access delegation (e.g., to financial advisors)

### Scenario 3: Healthcare Patient Portal

You're building a patient portal for a healthcare provider that needs to comply with HIPAA regulations.

Tasks:
a) Implement secure authentication that meets HIPAA requirements
b) Design a consent management system for patients to control access to their health records
c) Implement role-based access control for different types of healthcare providers
d) Design an audit system that logs all data access and changes

### Scenario 4: Multi-tenant SaaS Platform

You're developing authentication and authorization for a SaaS platform that serves multiple organizations.

Tasks:
a) Implement a multi-tenant authentication system that supports custom domains
b) Design a flexible permissions system that allows each tenant to define custom roles
c) Implement cross-tenant authentication for collaboration features
d) Design a system for managing API keys and permissions for each tenant

### Scenario 5: IoT Smart Home System

You're creating an authentication and authorization system for a smart home IoT platform.

Tasks:
a) Implement secure device authentication and pairing process
b) Design a system for managing user permissions for different smart home devices
c) Implement temporary access grants for guests or service providers
d) Design a secure way to handle voice-based authentication for smart assistants

# Constraints

- For all versions:
  - Implement proper password policies (complexity, expiration, history)
  - Use secure communication protocols (HTTPS, TLS)
  - Implement protection against brute-force attacks

- For Version 4 (Real-Life Domain Cases):
  - Ensure compliance with relevant regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, PSD2, etc.)
  - Consider scalability for systems with millions of users
  - Implement proper logging and auditing without exposing sensitive information

# Notes

- Always use industry-standard cryptographic libraries for authentication operations
- Implement proper session management (secure creation, storage, and destruction)
- Use secure random number generators for creating tokens and salts
- Consider implementing OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect for standardized authentication and authorization
- Regularly review and update access controls to ensure least privilege principle
- Implement proper error handling that doesn't reveal sensitive information
- Consider using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for stateless authentication in distributed systems
- Stay informed about the latest authentication methods and best practices in identity management
