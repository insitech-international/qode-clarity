# Problem Description

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) provides a comprehensive set of best practices for securing web applications. This problem focuses on implementing these best practices to protect against common vulnerabilities and attacks.

# Versions

## Version 1: OWASP Top 10 Mitigation

Implement security measures to address the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities in a web application.

Example:
- Input: A web application with potential vulnerabilities from the OWASP Top 10 list
- Output: Describe the implemented security measures for each of the top 10 vulnerabilities

## Version 2: Secure Headers Implementation

Implement and configure secure HTTP headers as recommended by OWASP.

Example:
- Input: A list of HTTP headers to be implemented (e.g., Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection)
- Output: Describe the implementation and configuration of each header, explaining its security benefits

## Version 3: OWASP ASVS Compliance

Implement security controls to achieve compliance with the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) at a specified level.

Example:
- Input: ASVS Level 2 requirements for a web application
- Output: Describe the implementation of security controls to meet Level 2 requirements, including authentication, session management, and access control

## Version 4: Real-Life Domain Cases

### Scenario 1: E-commerce Platform Security

You're tasked with securing a large e-commerce platform using OWASP best practices.

Tasks:
a) Implement secure payment processing following PCI DSS and OWASP guidelines
b) Design a secure session management system to prevent session hijacking and fixation
c) Implement secure file upload functionality for product images and user avatars
d) Design and implement a secure API for third-party integrations (e.g., shipping providers, payment gateways)

### Scenario 2: Healthcare Portal Security

You're developing a patient portal for a healthcare provider that needs to comply with HIPAA and follow OWASP best practices.

Tasks:
a) Implement secure authentication and authorization system following OWASP guidelines
b) Design a secure system for handling and storing sensitive patient data
c) Implement secure communication channels for telemedicine features
d) Design and implement a robust audit logging system for all data access and changes

### Scenario 3: Financial Services Application Security

You're securing a mobile banking application using OWASP Mobile Top 10 and other best practices.

Tasks:
a) Implement secure local data storage for sensitive user information
b) Design a secure communication protocol between the mobile app and backend servers
c) Implement runtime application self-protection (RASP) techniques
d) Design and implement a secure mechanism for transaction signing and authorization

### Scenario 4: Cloud-based SaaS Application Security

You're enhancing the security of a multi-tenant SaaS application using OWASP best practices.

Tasks:
a) Implement secure tenant isolation in a shared database environment
b) Design a robust identity and access management system for multi-tenancy
c) Implement secure CI/CD practices following OWASP guidelines
d) Design and implement a comprehensive logging and monitoring system for security events

### Scenario 5: IoT Device Management Platform Security

You're securing an IoT device management platform using OWASP IoT Top 10 and other best practices.

Tasks:
a) Implement secure device authentication and provisioning processes
b) Design a secure over-the-air (OTA) update system for IoT devices
c) Implement secure data collection and transmission from IoT devices to the cloud
d) Design and implement a secure API for device management and data access

# Constraints

- For all versions:
  - Implement security measures without significantly impacting application performance
  - Ensure backward compatibility when implementing new security features
  - Consider the balance between security and user experience

- For Version 4 (Real-Life Domain Cases):
  - Comply with relevant industry regulations and standards
  - Consider scalability for enterprise-level applications
  - Implement security measures that can adapt to evolving threats

# Notes

- Regularly update and patch all systems and dependencies
- Implement a defense-in-depth strategy, not relying on a single security control
- Use threat modeling to identify and prioritize potential vulnerabilities
- Implement proper error handling and logging without exposing sensitive information
- Conduct regular security assessments and penetration testing
- Foster a security-aware development culture through training and best practices
- Stay informed about the latest security threats and OWASP guidelines
- Consider implementing a bug bounty program to identify and address vulnerabilities
- Use OWASP tools and resources (e.g., OWASP ZAP, OWASP Dependency-Check) in the development process
