# Problem Description

UDP (User Datagram Protocol) sockets provide a connectionless, datagram-based service for network communication. Unlike TCP, UDP does not guarantee delivery or order of packets, making it suitable for applications requiring fast, best-effort delivery. This problem focuses on implementing and utilizing UDP sockets in Python, exploring their unique characteristics, and addressing challenges specific to unreliable protocols.

The challenge involves understanding the UDP protocol, managing packet loss and out-of-order delivery, and dealing with network-related issues such as port conflicts and multicast/broadcast communication. It requires a solid grasp of networking fundamentals, error handling techniques, and knowledge of scenarios where UDP is preferable to TCP.
