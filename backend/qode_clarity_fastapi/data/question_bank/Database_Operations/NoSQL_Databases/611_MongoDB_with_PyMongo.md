# Problem Description

MongoDB is a popular NoSQL document-oriented database that provides high performance, scalability, and flexibility. It stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, making it suitable for handling unstructured and semi-structured data. PyMongo is the official Python driver for MongoDB, allowing seamless interaction with MongoDB databases from Python applications.

In the context of your code clarity project, integrating MongoDB using PyMongo can enhance your system's ability to handle diverse data types, scale horizontally, and perform real-time analytics. By leveraging MongoDB's document model and PyMongo's intuitive API, you can efficiently store, retrieve, and manipulate data in a flexible and scalable manner.

# Versions

## Version 1. Basic CRUD Operations

Implement basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using PyMongo:

- Connect to a MongoDB database and create a new collection
- Insert documents into the collection
- Retrieve documents based on specific criteria
- Update existing documents with new information
- Delete documents that are no longer needed

## Version 2. Data Modeling and Schema Design

Design an effective data model and schema for your MongoDB collections:

- Identify the entities and relationships in your application
- Determine the appropriate document structure for each entity
- Utilize embedding and referencing techniques to model relationships
- Optimize the schema for query performance and data accessibility

## Version 3. Indexing and Query Optimization

Improve query performance by creating indexes and optimizing queries:

- Analyze query patterns and identify fields that require indexing
- Create single-field and compound indexes to support common queries
- Utilize explain() to analyze query execution and identify bottlenecks
- Optimize queries by using appropriate operators and limiting the returned fields

## Version 4. Aggregation and Data Analysis

Perform advanced data aggregation and analysis using MongoDB's aggregation framework:

- Use the aggregation pipeline to process and transform data
- Perform grouping, filtering, and sorting operations on the data
- Calculate aggregate values and generate statistical insights
- Integrate MongoDB with data visualization tools for effective reporting

## Version 5. Real-Life Scenarios

### Scenario 1: E-commerce Product Catalog

You are working on an e-commerce platform that needs to store and manage a large product catalog. Your manager has asked you to design and implement the product catalog using MongoDB and PyMongo. The system should allow for efficient product searches, filtering based on various criteria, and real-time updates to product information.

**Questions:**
1. How would you model the product catalog data in MongoDB to support flexible attributes and variations?
2. What indexes would you create to optimize product search and filtering performance?
3. How would you handle real-time updates to product information across multiple nodes in a MongoDB cluster?

### Scenario 2: User Activity Tracking

You are part of a team developing a social media application that needs to track user activities and interactions. The application generates a high volume of user activity data, including likes, comments, and shares. Your task is to design and implement a scalable solution using MongoDB and PyMongo to store and analyze user activity data.

**Questions:**
1. How would you structure the user activity data in MongoDB to support efficient querying and aggregation?
2. What strategies would you employ to handle the high write throughput of user activity data?
3. How would you perform real-time analytics on user activity data to generate insights and recommendations?

### Scenario 3: Geospatial Data Management

You are working on a location-based service that requires storing and querying geospatial data. The service needs to handle a large number of user locations and perform real-time proximity searches. Your manager has asked you to implement a solution using MongoDB and PyMongo to efficiently store and query geospatial data.

**Questions:**
1. How would you model the geospatial data in MongoDB to support efficient storage and querying?
2. What indexes would you create to optimize the performance of geospatial queries?
3. How would you implement real-time proximity searches to find nearby locations based on a given radius?

# Constraints

1. Ensure proper handling of connection errors and exceptions.
2. Implement proper data validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks.
3. Use appropriate data types and schema design to optimize storage and retrieval.
4. Implement proper indexing strategies to improve query performance.
5. Handle data consistency and integrity when performing write operations.
6. Ensure proper handling of concurrent access and avoid race conditions.
7. Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
8. Optimize memory usage and avoid excessive data loading.
9. Implement proper error handling and logging for debugging purposes.
10. Ensure compatibility with the latest versions of MongoDB and PyMongo.

# Notes

- Use the `pymongo` library to interact with MongoDB from Python.
- Utilize the `mongodb` URI format for connecting to MongoDB instances.
- Leverage the `MongoClient` class to establish a connection to the database.
- Use the `db` attribute of the `MongoClient` to access specific databases.
- Access collections using the dot notation or dictionary-style access on the `db` object.
- Use the `insert_one()`, `insert_many()`, `find()`, `update_one()`, `update_many()`, `delete_one()`, and `delete_many()` methods for CRUD operations.
- Utilize the `find()` method with query operators like `$gt`, `$lt`, `$in`, `$regex`, etc., to filter documents.
- Use the `sort()`, `limit()`, and `skip()` methods to control the order and subset of returned documents.
- Leverage the aggregation framework with the `aggregate()` method for advanced data processing and analysis.
- Create indexes using the `create_index()` method to optimize query performance.
- Handle exceptions and errors using try-except blocks and proper error handling mechanisms.
- Implement logging to track and debug database operations.
- Ensure proper closing of database connections to avoid resource leaks.
