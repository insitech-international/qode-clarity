# Problem Description

Coverage.py is a powerful tool for measuring code coverage of Python programs. It provides insights into which parts of your code were executed during testing and which remain untested. This problem delves into the effective utilization of coverage.py to analyze and enhance the test coverage of Python projects, with a particular emphasis on integration with the Pytest testing framework.

The challenge involves understanding the intricacies of code coverage measurement, interpreting coverage reports, and leveraging this information to improve the overall quality and reliability of software systems. It requires a deep comprehension of testing strategies, code organization, and the interplay between test suites and production code.
