# Problem Description

CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files are a common format for storing tabular data. They consist of lines of text where each line contains a series of fields, typically separated by commas. This problem focuses on implementing various CSV-related operations, exploring their syntax, and addressing common challenges in CSV handling.

The challenge involves understanding CSV data structures, parsing and generating CSV content, validating CSV data, and developing robust CSV operation strategies. It requires a solid grasp of Python's CSV capabilities, understanding different CSV formats, and knowing how to work with CSV efficiently.

# Versions

## Version 1: Basic CSV Operations

Implement basic CSV operations for reading and writing CSV files.

Tasks:

1. Create a function to read a CSV file using csv.reader and return its content as a list of lists.
2. Develop a function to write a list of lists to a CSV file using csv.writer.
3. Implement a function to read a CSV file using csv.DictReader and return its content as a dictionary.
4. Create a function to write a dictionary to a CSV file using csv.DictWriter.
5. Develop a function to handle CSV files with different delimiters (e.g., semicolon instead of comma).
6. Implement a function to skip header rows when reading a CSV file.
7. Explain the difference between csv.reader and csv.DictReader.

## Version 2: Advanced CSV Manipulation

Practice more advanced CSV manipulation techniques.

Tasks:

1. Implement a function to parse CSV files with quoted fields containing commas.
2. Develop a function to handle CSV files with missing or empty fields.
3. Create a function to merge two CSV files based on a common column.
4. Implement a function to split large CSV files into smaller chunks.
5. Develop a feature to detect and handle duplicate rows in a CSV file.
6. Create a function to calculate statistics (mean, median, sum) for numeric columns in a CSV file.
7. Explain the concept of CSV dialects and how to work with them.

## Version 3: Working with Large CSV Files

Learn to handle large CSV files efficiently.

Tasks:

1. Implement a function to stream large CSV files without loading entire content into memory.
2. Develop a function to process CSV data in chunks for real-time analysis.
3. Create a function to parallelize CSV parsing for multiple files.
4. Implement a system to handle partial CSV data and incomplete records.
5. Develop a feature to optimize CSV serialization for space efficiency.
6. Create a function to handle circular references in nested CSV structures.
7. Explain the trade-offs between different CSV parsing approaches (recursive vs. iterative).

## Version 4: CSV Validation and Cleaning

Implement functions for validating and cleaning CSV data.

Tasks:

1. Develop a function to validate CSV schema against a given CSV instance.
2. Create a function to clean CSV data by removing leading/trailing whitespaces and trimming quotes.
3. Implement a system to handle encoding issues in CSV files.
4. Develop a feature to convert data types in CSV columns (e.g., string to integer).
5. Create a function to detect and handle inconsistent data formats in CSV columns.
6. Implement a system to generate reports on data quality metrics for CSV files.
7. Explain the importance of data validation in CSV operations.

## Version 5: Real-World Applications

Apply CSV handling concepts to various real-world scenarios, demonstrating its importance in modern software development.

### Scenario 1: Data Import Tool

Build a tool for importing data from various sources into a database using CSV files.

Tasks:

1. Develop a function to read CSV files from different sources (local, URL, FTP).
2. Implement a system to map CSV columns to database table columns.
3. Create a function to handle bulk inserts of CSV data into the database.
4. Develop a feature to track import progress and report errors.
5. Implement a system to handle data type conversions between CSV and database.
6. Create a function to log and report on data integrity checks performed during import.
7. Develop a system to schedule periodic imports and manage dependencies between tables.

### Scenario 2: Business Intelligence Dashboard

Create a dashboard that reads sales data from CSV files and generates visualizations.

Tasks:

1. Develop a function to read and aggregate sales data from multiple CSV files.
2. Implement a system to handle missing or invalid data in CSV files.
3. Create a function to perform calculations on aggregated data (e.g., total revenue, average price).
4. Develop a feature to generate pivot tables from CSV data.
5. Implement a system to update dashboards automatically when new CSV data is added.
6. Create a function to handle security access controls for sensitive CSV data.
7. Develop a system to generate alerts based on predefined thresholds in CSV data.

### Scenario 3: ETL Pipeline

Build an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline that processes data stored in CSV files.

Tasks:

1. Develop a function to extract data from CSV files using different compression algorithms.
2. Implement a system to transform raw data in CSV files (e.g., date formatting, currency conversion).
3. Create a function to load transformed data into a target database or data warehouse.
4. Develop a feature to handle incremental loads of new data in CSV files.
5. Implement a system to manage metadata about CSV files and their transformations.
6. Create a function to generate reports on ETL job performance and data quality.
7. Develop a system to handle versioning and rollback of ETL jobs.

# Constraints

- Ensure proper handling of special characters and escape sequences in CSV data.
- Validate CSV data thoroughly to prevent injection attacks.
- Balance between strict validation and flexibility in handling user-generated CSV data.
- Consider the impact of CSV parsing on application performance, especially for large datasets.
- Ensure compatibility with different CSV parsers and libraries.

# Notes

- Explore the use of pandas library for efficient CSV handling in data analysis tasks.
- Investigate the benefits and drawbacks of using csv module versus pandas for CSV operations.
- Research and discuss the concept of CSV streaming and its advantages in certain scenarios.
- Consider the role of CSV in big data processing pipelines and distributed computing systems.
