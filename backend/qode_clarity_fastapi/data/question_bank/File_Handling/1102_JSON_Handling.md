# Problem Description

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format widely used in web and mobile applications. This problem focuses on implementing various JSON-related operations, exploring their syntax, and addressing common challenges in JSON handling.

The challenge involves understanding JSON data structures, parsing and generating JSON content, validating JSON data, and developing robust JSON operation strategies. It requires a solid grasp of Python's JSON capabilities, understanding different JSON formats, and knowing how to work with JSON efficiently.

# Versions

## Version 1: Basic JSON Operations

Implement basic JSON operations for reading, writing, and manipulating JSON data.

Tasks:

1. Create a function to parse a JSON string into a Python dictionary.
2. Develop a function to convert a Python dictionary to a JSON string.
3. Implement a function to dump a Python object to a JSON file.
4. Create a function to load JSON data from a file.
5. Develop a function to update nested JSON values.
6. Implement a function to flatten a nested JSON structure.
7. Explain the difference between JSON and Python dictionaries.

## Version 2: Advanced JSON Manipulation

Practice more advanced JSON manipulation techniques.

Tasks:

1. Implement a function to merge two JSON objects.
2. Develop a function to remove duplicate keys from a JSON object.
3. Create a function to sort JSON objects by key.
4. Implement a function to validate JSON schema against a given JSON instance.
5. Develop a function to convert JSON to a different format (e.g., XML).
6. Create a function to calculate the size of a JSON object in bytes.
7. Explain the concept of JSON Patch and its applications.

## Version 3: Working with Large JSON Files

Learn to handle large JSON files efficiently.

Tasks:

1. Implement a function to stream large JSON files without loading entire content into memory.
2. Develop a function to process JSON data in chunks for real-time analysis.
3. Create a function to parallelize JSON parsing for multiple files.
4. Implement a system to handle partial JSON data and incomplete records.
5. Develop a feature to optimize JSON serialization for space efficiency.
6. Create a function to handle circular references in JSON data.
7. Explain the trade-offs between different JSON parsing approaches (recursive vs. iterative).

## Version 4: JSON Schema Validation

Implement JSON schema validation and related operations.

Tasks:

1. Develop a function to validate JSON data against a predefined schema.
2. Create a function to generate a JSON schema from sample data.
3. Implement a system to enforce JSON schema constraints during runtime.
4. Develop a feature to suggest corrections for invalid JSON data based on the schema.
5. Create a function to convert JSON schemas to Python classes.
6. Implement a system to generate documentation from JSON schemas.
7. Explain the benefits and limitations of using JSON schemas for data validation.

## Version 5: Real-World Applications

Apply JSON handling concepts to various real-world scenarios, demonstrating its importance in modern software development.

### Scenario 1: RESTful API Client

Build a client for a RESTful API that communicates using JSON.

Tasks:

1. Develop a function to send POST requests with JSON payloads.
2. Implement a system to handle authentication tokens in JSON responses.
3. Create a function to parse and extract data from JSON responses.
4. Develop a feature to retry failed requests with exponential backoff.
5. Implement a system to cache JSON responses for improved performance.
6. Create a function to handle pagination in JSON responses.
7. Develop a system to validate incoming JSON data against predefined schemas.

### Scenario 2: Configuration Management Tool

Create a tool for managing application configurations stored in JSON format.

Tasks:

1. Develop a function to read and write configuration files in JSON format.
2. Implement a system to validate configuration values against predefined rules.
3. Create a function to merge multiple configuration files.
4. Develop a feature to apply configuration changes without restarting the application.
5. Implement a system to track changes in configuration files over time.
6. Create a function to convert configuration values to human-readable format.
7. Develop a system to generate diffs between different versions of configurations.

### Scenario 3: Data Transformation Pipeline

Build a pipeline for transforming and enriching data stored in JSON format.

Tasks:

1. Develop a function to map fields between different JSON schemas.
2. Implement a system to perform data enrichment using external services.
3. Create a function to handle missing or null values in JSON data.
4. Develop a feature to normalize JSON data across different sources.
5. Implement a system to detect and handle inconsistencies in JSON data.
6. Create a function to generate summaries of large JSON datasets.
7. Develop a system to schedule periodic data transformations and report on their progress.

# Constraints

- Ensure proper handling of Unicode characters in JSON data.
- Validate JSON data thoroughly to prevent injection attacks.
- Balance between strict validation and flexibility in handling user-generated JSON data.
- Consider the impact of JSON parsing on application performance, especially for large datasets.
- Ensure compatibility with different JSON parsers and libraries.

# Notes

- Explore the use of JSON-specific libraries like ujson for performance-critical applications.
- Investigate the benefits and drawbacks of using JSON over other data formats for specific use cases.
- Research and discuss the concept of JSON streaming and its advantages in certain scenarios.
- Consider the role of JSON in microservices architecture and distributed systems.
