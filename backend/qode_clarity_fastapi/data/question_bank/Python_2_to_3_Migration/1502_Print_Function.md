# Problem Description

One of the most noticeable changes in the transition from Python 2 to Python 3 is the print statement becoming a function. This problem focuses on understanding and adapting to this change in various contexts.

# Versions

## Version 1: Basic Print Statement to Function

In Python 2, print is a statement. In Python 3, it's a function.

Example:

- Python 2: print "Hello, World!"
- Python 3: print("Hello, World!")

Task: Convert a Python 2 script that uses print statements to use the print function in Python 3.

## Version 2: Print with Multiple Arguments

Consider how multiple arguments to print are handled differently in Python 2 and 3.

Example:

- Python 2: print "The answer is", 42
- Python 3: print("The answer is", 42)

Task: Modify a script that uses print with multiple arguments to work correctly in Python 3.

## Version 3: Print with Keyword Arguments

Examine how Python 3's print function allows for more flexible output control through keyword arguments.

Example:

- Python 2: print >> sys.stderr, "Error:"
- Python 3: print("Error:", file=sys.stderr)

Task: Refactor error logging code that uses print redirection to use Python 3's print function keyword arguments.

## Version 4: Real-Life Domain Cases

### Scenario 1: Logging and Debugging

In software development, print statements are often used for quick debugging and logging.

Task:
a) Update a debug logging function to use Python 3's print function with appropriate separators and end characters.
b) Modify an error reporting system that uses print redirection to write to different output streams.
c) Refactor a verbose mode option in a command-line tool to use the flush parameter of the print function.

### Scenario 2: Data Analysis and Visualization

Data scientists often use print for outputting analysis results and data summaries.

Task:
a) Update a data summary function that prints formatted tables to use Python 3's print function.
b) Modify a progress indicator for long-running analyses to use the end parameter of the print function.
c) Refactor a machine learning model's training output to use formatted strings with the print function.

### Scenario 3: System Administration

System administrators use Python scripts for various tasks that involve printing system information and logs.

Task:
a) Update a system monitoring script that prints real-time information to use Python 3's print function with appropriate flushing.
b) Modify a log parsing tool that prints filtered log entries to different files using file redirection.
c) Refactor a network diagnostics tool that prints formatted output of ping results.

### Scenario 4: Education and Training

Programming tutorials and educational materials need to be updated to reflect the new print function syntax.

Task:
a) Update a series of beginner Python tutorials to use the Python 3 print function syntax.
b) Modify an interactive coding exercise platform to accept both Python 2 and 3 print syntax, with appropriate feedback.
c) Refactor a code grading system to correctly evaluate student submissions using either print syntax.

### Scenario 5: Legacy System Migration

Many organizations need to migrate large codebases from Python 2 to 3.

Task:
a) Develop a strategy for identifying and updating all print statements in a large legacy codebase.
b) Create a custom 2to3 fixers to handle complex print statement use cases in legacy code.
c) Implement a compatibility layer that allows print statements to work in both Python 2 and 3 environments during a phased migration.

# Constraints

- Ensure backward compatibility with Python 2 if required.
- Consider performance implications, especially when frequently writing to stdout or other streams.
- Be aware of differences in buffering behavior between Python 2 and 3 print operations.

# Notes

- The `from __future__ import print_function` statement can be used in Python 2 to get Python 3 print function behavior.
- In Python 3, `print()` without arguments prints a blank line, unlike in Python 2.
- The `sep`, `end`, `file`, and `flush` parameters of the print function offer more control over output.
- For complex string formatting, consider using f-strings (Python 3.6+) or the `format()` method instead of comma-separated print arguments.
- When migrating large codebases, automated tools like `2to3` or `futurize` can help, but manual review is often necessary.
- In performance-critical code, consider using `sys.stdout.write()` directly instead of `print()`.
