# Problem Description

Imagine you're developing a web crawler for a popular e-commerce website. Your task is to create a multithreaded application that efficiently crawls product pages, extracts relevant information, and stores it in a database. The challenge lies in managing multiple threads to handle concurrent requests and avoid overwhelming the server, while also ensuring proper handling of exceptions and resource management.

A context manager would be useful in this scenario to handle the setup and teardown of resources efficiently, manage thread safety, and ensure proper cleanup even if an exception occurs during crawling.

# Versions

## Version 1: Basic Web Crawler

Your task is to develop a multithreaded web crawler that visits product pages on an e-commerce website. The crawler should:

- Start with a given seed URL
- Follow hyperlinks on each page
- Extract product names and prices
- Store extracted data in a local database
- Handle rate limiting to avoid overwhelming the server
- Implement error handling for broken links or server errors
- Manage thread synchronization to prevent race conditions

You need to implement a context manager that handles resource acquisition (opening connections), manages concurrent operations, and ensures proper cleanup of threads and resources.

## Version 2: Advanced Web Crawler

Expand upon the basic crawler by adding the following features:

- Implement a priority queue to focus on crawling high-value pages first
- Add support for user authentication to access protected pages
- Implement a mechanism to detect and avoid duplicate pages
- Add support for crawling deep links within product categories
- Implement a rate limiting strategy to comply with the website's robots.txt file
- Add support for storing crawled data in a distributed cache system
- Implement a logging system to track crawler progress and errors

Your task is to update the context manager to handle these advanced features while maintaining efficient resource management and thread safety.

## Version 3: Web Crawler with Asynchronous Operations

Your task is to refactor the web crawler to use asynchronous operations instead of multithreading. Implement an async context manager that:

- Uses asyncio to manage concurrent operations
- Implements a priority queue for efficient task scheduling
- Handles HTTP requests asynchronously using aiohttp
- Manages connection pooling efficiently
- Implements rate limiting using asyncio.sleep()
- Adds support for parallel processing of extracted data
- Implements graceful shutdown handling for long-running tasks

Your goal is to demonstrate how context managers can be adapted to work with asynchronous programming paradigms while maintaining the benefits of automatic resource management and exception handling.

## Version 4: Web Crawler with Database Integration

Your task is to integrate the web crawler with a database system. Implement a context manager that:

- Connects to a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for storing crawled data
- Implements transactions to ensure data integrity during crawling
- Supports batch inserts for improved performance
- Implements a caching mechanism to reduce redundant database calls
- Adds support for scheduled crawls and incremental updates
- Implements a backup and restore feature for the database
- Adds support for generating reports on crawl statistics and performance metrics

Your goal is to demonstrate how context managers can be extended to handle complex database interactions while maintaining thread safety and efficient resource management.

# Constraints

- Ensure proper resource acquisition and release for network connections, database connections, and file handles.
- Implement efficient thread synchronization mechanisms to prevent race conditions.
- Provide a structured approach to setup and teardown operations for each component of the crawler.
- Handle potential exceptions and cleanup resources accordingly.
- Offer flexibility for customizing crawling behavior and database operations.
- Support concurrent access control and thread safety throughout the entire crawling process.
- Implement efficient memory management for large-scale operations.
- Ensure compliance with ethical web scraping practices and website terms of service.
- Optimize performance for real-time operations and minimize server load.
- Support historical data tracking and analysis of crawled information.
- Implement proper scoping and cleanup of temporary resources.
- Provide tools for testing and mocking crawler behavior.
- Enable easy configuration and customization of crawling parameters.
- Support integration with other Python libraries and frameworks commonly used in web development.

# Notes

- Automatic Resource Management: Contextlib managers ensure that resources are properly allocated and released, reducing the risk of resource leaks in a multithreaded environment.
- Error Handling: They provide a structured approach to exception handling, allowing for more graceful error recovery in a distributed system.
- Code Readability: By encapsulating setup and teardown logic, contextlib managers contribute to more readable and maintainable code, especially when working with complex systems like web crawlers.
- Flexibility: They offer reusable patterns for common programming tasks, promoting code reuse and consistency across different components of the crawler.
- Integration with Built-in Functions: Many built-in Python functions (like open()) are already context managers, making integration seamless for file operations related to logging or data storage.
- Customization: Developers can create custom context managers to solve domain-specific problems, improving code organization and reusability in the web crawling domain.
- Asynchronous Support: Recent versions of Python (3.10+) support asynchronous context managers, enabling efficient handling of asynchronous operations in the crawler.
- The @contextmanager decorator allows creating generator-based context managers without defining separate **enter**() and **exit**() methods, useful for managing complex state machines in the crawling process.
- The closing() function provides a convenient way to automatically close objects that support the context manager protocol, such as database connections or file handles.
- The suppress() function helps suppress specific exceptions within a context manager, which can be useful for handling transient errors during crawling.
- The redirect_stdout() and redirect_stderr() functions allow redirecting stdout and stderr within a context manager, useful for logging and error reporting in a multithreaded environment.

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

#### **Best Practices:**

- Keep context managers focused: Each context manager should handle a single responsibility, such as managing a specific resource or operation.
- Use contextlib.contextmanager for simple cases: It simplifies the creation of context managers, especially for complex operations like database transactions.
- Always ensure cleanup: The **exit** method should handle all cleanup, even in error cases, to prevent resource leaks in a multithreaded environment.
- Be careful with return values: The **exit** method's return value determines exception propagation, which is crucial for proper error handling in a distributed system.
- Use type hints: They improve code readability and catch potential errors early, especially when working with complex data structures like priority queues.
- Document clearly: Explain what the context manager does, especially any side effects, to aid in understanding and maintenance of the web crawler.

#### **Common Pitfalls:**

- Forgetting to release resources: Always release resources in the **exit** method to prevent resource leaks, especially in a multithreaded environment.
- Ignoring exceptions: Be cautious about silently catching exceptions in **exit**, as this might mask important errors in the crawling process.
- Performing too much in **enter**: Keep **enter** focused on setup to avoid exceptions before the context is fully entered, which could lead to resource allocation failures.
- Not considering thread safety: If the context manager might be used in multithreaded environments, ensure it's thread-safe to prevent race conditions and data corruption.
- Overuse of context managers: While powerful, they're not always necessary for simple operations. Balance their use with simpler alternatives when appropriate.
