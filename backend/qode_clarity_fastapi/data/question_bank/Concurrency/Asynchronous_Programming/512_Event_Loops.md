# Problem Description

In this challenge, we'll focus on implementing and utilizing event loops in Python's asyncio module. Event loops are the core of asynchronous programming, managing the execution of coroutines and handling I/O operations efficiently.

Your task is to demonstrate deep understanding of event loop concepts and their practical applications. Pay close attention to coroutine scheduling, task management, and efficient resource utilization in asynchronous environments.

# Versions

## Version 1: Basic Event Loop Implementation

Your task is to create a custom event loop class that extends asyncio.BaseEventLoop. Include:

- Implementing core event loop functionalities like run_until_complete(), call_soon(), call_later()
- Managing a queue of pending coroutines
- Handling signal and interrupt events
- Demonstrating proper shutdown procedure

## Version 2: Event Loop with Custom Scheduler

Expand upon the basic implementation by adding a custom scheduler to your event loop. Include:

- Implementing a priority-based scheduling mechanism
- Supporting periodic tasks with configurable intervals
- Demonstrating how to schedule coroutines with different priorities
- Handling task cancellation and rescheduling

## Version 3: Event Loop with Concurrency Control

Your task is to refactor the previous implementations to include concurrency control mechanisms. Include:

- Implementing a maximum number of concurrent tasks
- Supporting task grouping for coordinated execution
- Demonstrating how to limit parallelism in I/O-bound operations
- Showing how to implement cooperative multitasking within the event loop

## Version 4: Advanced Event Loop Patterns

Enhance your event loop implementation by incorporating advanced patterns and optimizations. Include:

- Implementing a load-balancing strategy for distributed task execution
- Adding support for graceful shutdown with timeout
- Demonstrating how to integrate with external event sources (e.g., web sockets, timers)
- Implementing a mechanism to detect and recover from event loop crashes

# Constraints

- Ensure proper integration with Python's asyncio module and its standard library components.
- Implement efficient scheduling and execution of coroutines within the event loop.
- Provide clear documentation on the purpose and usage of each component.
- Handle potential exceptions and edge cases in asynchronous operations.
- Optimize performance for I/O-bound operations and minimize latency.
- Support integration with popular Python libraries for networking and I/O operations (e.g., aiohttp, aioredis).
- Implement proper scoping and cleanup of resources in asynchronous contexts.
- Provide tools for testing and mocking asynchronous behaviors.
- Enable easy configuration and customization of asynchronous parameters.
- Support integration with frameworks like FastAPI or Starlette for building production-ready async applications.

# Notes

- Coroutine Execution: Demonstrate how to execute coroutines efficiently within the event loop, considering the unique characteristics of coroutine execution.
- Task Management: Utilize asyncio.create_task() and asyncio.gather() for efficient concurrent execution of coroutines within the event loop.
- Signal Handling: Implement proper handling of signals and interrupts in the event loop, demonstrating graceful shutdown procedures.
- Performance Optimization: Leverage asyncio's built-in optimizations for I/O-bound operations and minimize unnecessary context switching.
- Concurrency Control: Implement mechanisms to control concurrency in asynchronous applications, such as limiting parallel executions or managing worker pools.

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

#### **Best Practices:**

- Use async/await syntax consistently throughout your code for readability and maintainability.
- Prefer asyncio.create_task() over threading.Thread for CPU-bound tasks to avoid the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).
- Implement proper error handling and logging in asynchronous code to aid in debugging and maintenance.
- Use asyncio.run() for running top-level coroutines, avoiding the need for manual loop creation.
- Leverage asyncio.gather() for concurrent execution of multiple coroutines within the event loop.
- Use asyncio.TimeoutError for implementing timeout-based operations in asynchronous code.
- Document the purpose and behavior of each asynchronous component clearly.

#### **Common Pitfalls:**

- Mixing synchronous and asynchronous code without proper synchronization, leading to deadlocks or race conditions.
- Overusing asyncio.gather() for too many concurrent operations, potentially overwhelming the event loop.
- Ignoring the difference between blocking and non-blocking operations in asynchronous contexts.
- Not properly closing resources in asynchronous cleanup procedures.
- Misunderstanding the concept of "blocking" in asynchronous programming, particularly regarding I/O operations.
- Overcomplicating asynchronous code with nested callbacks, when simpler solutions exist using async/await.
- Failing to handle edge cases like connection timeouts or network failures in asynchronous operations.
