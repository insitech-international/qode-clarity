# Problem Description

Implement efficient concurrent programming solutions in Python using both multithreading and multiprocessing techniques. Understand the differences between these approaches and apply them to solve various computational problems.

# Versions

## Version 1: HackerRank - Parallel Matrix Multiplication

Given two matrices A and B, implement a parallel algorithm to compute their product C = A \* B. Use both multithreading and multiprocessing approaches to optimize the computation for large matrices.

## Version 2: HackerRank - Concurrent Web Crawler

Implement a concurrent web crawler that visits URLs from a given starting point, following links up to a specified depth. Use threading to manage multiple concurrent requests and handle rate limiting to avoid overloading target servers.

## Version 3: Real-Life Scenario - Stock Market Data Processing

Develop a system to process real-time stock market data feeds. Use multiprocessing to handle data ingestion from multiple sources, perform calculations (e.g., moving averages, volatility), and update a shared database. Implement a separate thread for serving processed data to clients via a REST API.

## Version 4: Real-Life Scenario - Image Processing Pipeline

Create an image processing pipeline for a photo sharing application. Use a combination of multithreading and multiprocessing to handle image uploads, apply filters, generate thumbnails, and update metadata in a database. Ensure the system can handle high concurrency during peak usage times.

## Version 5: Real-Life Scenario - Distributed Task Queue

Implement a distributed task queue system similar to Celery. Use multiprocessing to manage worker processes that consume tasks from a shared queue. Implement task prioritization, retries for failed tasks, and a monitoring interface to track task statuses and worker health.

# Constraints

- For all versions:
  - Use Python's built-in `threading` and `multiprocessing` modules.
  - Ensure proper error handling and resource management.
  - Consider the GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) implications for CPU-bound tasks.
  - Implement appropriate synchronization mechanisms to avoid race conditions and deadlocks.

# Notes

- Multithreading is generally more suitable for I/O-bound tasks, while multiprocessing is better for CPU-bound tasks due to the GIL.
- When using multiprocessing, be aware of the overhead of creating and managing separate processes.
- In real-world scenarios, you might need to combine different concurrency techniques based on the specific requirements of your application.
- Consider using higher-level libraries like `concurrent.futures` for more convenient parallel execution.
- For distributed systems, explore technologies like Redis or RabbitMQ for inter-process communication and task queuing.
