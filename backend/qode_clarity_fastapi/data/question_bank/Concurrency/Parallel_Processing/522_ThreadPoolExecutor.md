# Problem Description

In this challenge, we'll focus on implementing and utilizing ThreadPoolExecutor in Python's concurrent.futures module. ThreadPoolExecutor allows us to leverage multiple threads for parallel processing, improving performance for I/O-bound tasks.

Your task is to demonstrate deep understanding of ThreadPoolExecutor concepts and their practical applications. Pay close attention to task submission, result retrieval, and efficient resource utilization in parallel environments.

# Versions

## Version 1: Basic ThreadPoolExecutor Implementation

Your task is to implement a simple ThreadPoolExecutor-based program that performs I/O-bound operations. Include:

- Creating a ThreadPoolExecutor instance with a specified number of workers
- Submitting multiple tasks to the executor
- Retrieving and processing results from submitted tasks
- Demonstrating proper shutdown procedure

## Version 2: ThreadPoolExecutor with Custom Worker Function

Expand upon the basic implementation by creating a custom worker function for your ThreadPoolExecutor. Include:

- Implementing a worker function that performs web scraping
- Using functools.partial() to customize the worker function with common arguments
- Demonstrating how to pass arguments to worker functions
- Showing how to handle exceptions raised by worker functions

## Version 3: ThreadPoolExecutor with Result Caching

Your task is to refactor the previous implementations to include a caching mechanism for intermediate results. Include:

- Implementing a shared memory cache using multiprocessing.Manager().dict()
- Storing partial results in the cache during computation
- Retrieving cached results when possible to avoid redundant calculations
- Demonstrating how caching improves performance for repeated computations

## Version 4: Advanced ThreadPoolExecutor Patterns

Enhance your ThreadPoolExecutor implementation by incorporating advanced patterns and optimizations. Include:

- Implementing a dynamic pool size adjustment based on workload
- Adding support for asynchronous task submission and retrieval
- Demonstrating how to integrate ThreadPoolExecutor with other concurrent.futures modules like ProcessPoolExecutor
- Implementing a mechanism to detect and handle thread failures

# Constraints

- Ensure proper integration with Python's concurrent.futures module and its standard library components.
- Implement efficient task submission and result retrieval mechanisms.
- Provide clear documentation on the purpose and usage of each component.
- Handle potential exceptions and edge cases in parallel processing operations.
- Optimize performance for I/O-bound operations and minimize overhead.
- Support integration with popular Python libraries for web scraping (e.g., requests, BeautifulSoup).
- Implement proper scoping and cleanup of resources in parallel environments.
- Provide tools for testing and mocking parallel behaviors.
- Enable easy configuration and customization of executor parameters.
- Support integration with frameworks like Scrapy for building production-ready scrapers.

# Notes

- Task Submission: Demonstrate various methods of submitting tasks to the ThreadPoolExecutor, including submit(), map(), and apply().
- Result Handling: Show how to retrieve and process results efficiently, considering both synchronous and asynchronous approaches.
- Exception Handling: Implement robust error handling for worker functions and unexpected exceptions during execution.
- Performance Optimization: Leverage ThreadPoolExecutor's built-in optimizations for I/O-bound tasks and minimize unnecessary context switching.
- Concurrency Control: Implement mechanisms to control concurrency in parallel applications, such as limiting parallel executions or managing worker pools dynamically.

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

#### **Best Practices:**

- Use functools.partial() to customize worker functions with common arguments for cleaner code.
- Implement proper error handling and logging in parallel code to aid in debugging and maintenance.
- Use concurrent.futures.as_completed() for retrieving results as soon as they're available, avoiding unnecessary waiting.
- Implement proper cleanup procedures to release resources efficiently in parallel environments.
- Document the purpose and behavior of each parallel component clearly.
- Be aware of the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) when working with CPU-bound tasks in ThreadPoolExecutor.

#### **Common Pitfalls:**

- Mixing synchronous and asynchronous code without proper synchronization, leading to race conditions or deadlocks.
- Overloading the CPU with too many worker threads, potentially overwhelming the system.
- Ignoring the GIL when working with CPU-bound tasks, which can limit parallelism.
- Not properly closing resources in parallel cleanup procedures.
- Misunderstanding the concept of "blocking" in parallel programming, particularly regarding I/O operations.
- Overcomplicating parallel code with nested callbacks, when simpler solutions exist using concurrent.futures.
- Failing to handle edge cases like worker crashes or unexpected exceptions in parallel operations.
