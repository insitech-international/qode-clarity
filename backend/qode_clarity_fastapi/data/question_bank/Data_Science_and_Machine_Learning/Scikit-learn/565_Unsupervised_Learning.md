# Problem Description

Unsupervised learning is a branch of machine learning where the goal is to discover hidden patterns, structures, or relationships in unlabeled data. Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning algorithms do not rely on predefined labels or target variables. Instead, they aim to explore and learn from the inherent structure of the data itself.

In real-world scenarios, unsupervised learning techniques are applied to various problems, such as customer segmentation, anomaly detection, image compression, and more. The choice of the appropriate unsupervised learning algorithm depends on the nature of the data, the desired insights, and the specific goals of the analysis.

# Versions

## Version 1: Customer Segmentation

Scenario:
You are working on a customer segmentation project for a retail company. The goal is to identify distinct customer segments based on their purchasing behavior, demographics, and other relevant features. The company wants to tailor its marketing strategies and personalize product recommendations for each segment.

Questions:

1. What are the suitable unsupervised learning algorithms for customer segmentation, such as K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, or DBSCAN? How can their performance be compared?
2. How can the optimal number of clusters be determined for the customer segmentation task? What are the techniques for evaluating the quality of the clusters, such as silhouette score or elbow method?
3. How can the resulting customer segments be interpreted and visualized? What are the techniques for understanding the characteristics and preferences of each segment?

## Version 2: Anomaly Detection

Scenario:
You are working on an anomaly detection project for a manufacturing company. The goal is to identify unusual patterns or outliers in the production data that may indicate potential defects or malfunctions. The company wants to proactively detect and address these anomalies to ensure product quality and minimize downtime.

Questions:

1. What are the suitable unsupervised learning algorithms for anomaly detection, such as one-class SVM, isolation forest, or local outlier factor? How can their performance be compared?
2. How can the model handle high-dimensional production data with multiple sensors and measurements? What are the techniques for feature selection or dimensionality reduction?
3. How can the model be evaluated to assess its effectiveness in detecting true anomalies? What are the appropriate evaluation metrics for anomaly detection tasks?

## Version 3: Image Compression

Scenario:
You are working on an image compression project for a digital media company. The goal is to reduce the size of images while preserving their visual quality. The company wants to optimize storage and transmission of large image datasets without significant loss of information.

Questions:

1. What are the suitable unsupervised learning algorithms for image compression, such as principal component analysis (PCA) or autoencoder neural networks? How can their performance be compared?
2. How can the model handle different image formats and resolutions? What are the preprocessing steps required for image data?
3. How can the compressed images be evaluated in terms of visual quality and compression ratio? What are the metrics for assessing the trade-off between compression and image fidelity?

# Constraints

1. How can the unsupervised learning algorithms be scaled to handle large-scale customer datasets with millions of records?
2. What are the computational constraints when training and deploying anomaly detection models in real-time production environments?
3. How can the image compression model be optimized for different target devices, such as smartphones or web browsers?
4. What are the privacy and security considerations when dealing with sensitive customer data in the segmentation project?
5. How can the unsupervised learning pipeline be integrated into the existing data infrastructure of the manufacturing company?

# Notes

1. What are the best practices for data preprocessing and normalization in unsupervised learning tasks?
2. How can domain knowledge be incorporated into the feature selection process for customer segmentation?
3. What are the considerations for handling imbalanced anomaly detection scenarios, where anomalies are rare compared to normal instances?
4. How can the image compression model be extended to handle video data or streaming content?
5. What are the guidelines for interpreting and communicating the insights derived from unsupervised learning algorithms to non-technical stakeholders?
