# Problem Description

Imagine you're a machine learning engineer transitioning from traditional programming to deep learning development. You need to understand and implement PyTorch's dynamic computational graphs and tensor operations to build efficient deep learning models.

Think of it like learning to use a professional kitchen after cooking at home. Just as a professional kitchen offers powerful tools and techniques that enable more sophisticated cooking, PyTorch provides powerful capabilities for building and training neural networks.

# Versions

## Version 1: Tensor Operations Scenario
You're building a data preprocessing pipeline for a computer vision project. Implement efficient tensor operations for batch processing of images, including normalization, transformation, and augmentation.

## Version 2: Autograd Implementation Scenario
