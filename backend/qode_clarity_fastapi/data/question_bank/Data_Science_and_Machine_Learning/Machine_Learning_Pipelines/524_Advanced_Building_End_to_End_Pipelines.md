# Problem Description

Imagine you're leading an ML infrastructure team at a large tech company. Your challenge is to create automated, reliable pipelines that handle everything from data ingestion to model deployment, ensuring reproducibility, monitoring, and maintenance of ML systems at scale.

Think of it like designing an automated car manufacturing line. Just as a manufacturing line needs to coordinate multiple stages from raw materials to finished product, your ML pipeline needs to orchestrate multiple steps from raw data to deployed model.

# Versions

## Version 1: Data Processing Pipeline Scenario
You're building a pipeline for processing and preparing large-scale text data. Design a system that handles data ingestion, cleaning, feature extraction, and validation while maintaining data integrity and versioning.

## Version 2: Training Pipeline Scenario
You're creating an automated training pipeline that handles experiment tracking, hyperparameter optimization, and model selection. Implement a system that manages training resources and ensures reproducibility.

## Version 3: Deployment Pipeline Scenario
You're developing a continuous deployment pipeline for ML models. Create a system that handles model validation, A/B testing, rollback capabilities, and monitoring in production.

## Version 4: AutoML Pipeline Scenario
You're building an automated pipeline that handles the entire ML lifecycle with minimal human intervention. Design a system that automates feature selection, model architecture search, and hyperparameter tuning.
