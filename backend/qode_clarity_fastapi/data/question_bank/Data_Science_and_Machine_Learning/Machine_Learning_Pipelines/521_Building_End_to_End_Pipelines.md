# Problem Description

Imagine you're making a big machine that helps a store, a hospital, or even a streaming service like Netflix work better. This machine, called a pipeline, has a lot of parts that need to work together to do something important, like recommending a movie you might like or spotting when something fishy is happening with a credit card.

Here’s how it works:

Collecting Information: First, the machine needs to gather data from different places. For example, it might pull customer shopping data from a store, health records from a hospital, or watch history from a streaming app. This is like collecting all your Lego pieces before you start building something cool.

Cleaning Up the Data: Just like how you need to sort and clean your Lego blocks before you start building, the machine needs to tidy up all the data so it’s ready to use. If a piece is missing or broken, the machine figures out what to do.

Picking Out the Best Parts (Features): Once the data is clean, the machine chooses the most important pieces that will help it do its job. For example, if it’s helping doctors know which patients might need to come back to the hospital, it picks out things like test results and notes from doctors.

Making Predictions: The machine then uses all this information to make predictions. It could be something like, “This person might enjoy this movie,” or “This car needs maintenance soon.”

Putting it to Work (Deployment): Now that the machine is smart, it’s time to put it to work. Just like setting up a video game system so you can play, the machine is set up so it can start giving recommendations or making alerts right away.

Keeping an Eye on Things (Monitoring): But you can’t just leave the machine and forget about it. You need to make sure it’s still working well and doesn’t get confused if something changes, like if new Lego pieces come out that it’s never seen before.

Making it Work for Big Groups (Scaling): If suddenly everyone in the world wants to use your machine at once, it needs to be ready to handle all that extra work. This is like making sure you have enough controllers so all your friends can play video games with you at the same time.

By building and taking care of this machine, you’re helping big companies and services work smoothly, find problems faster, and make better choices.

# Versions

## Version 1: Retail Industry – Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis

You are tasked with developing a pipeline that collects data from a mix of sources, including a central customer database, transaction logs from retail point-of-sale (POS) systems, and third-party loyalty program APIs.
The data must be normalized and standardized to handle different formats (e.g., JSON, CSV, XML).

**Questions:**

- What challenges do you anticipate in integrating data from heterogeneous sources, and how would you address data latency or syncing issues?
- How would you deal with missing or inconsistent data to ensure the data fed into the pipeline is reliable?

**Coding Task:**

- Write a function that reads data from two sources (CSV and JSON) and merges them into a single Pandas DataFrame.

## Version 2: Healthcare – Predicting Patient Readmission Rates

You need to construct features from patient electronic health records (EHRs), including clinical notes, lab results, and historical visit data, to predict readmission risk.
The pipeline must preprocess both structured (numerical lab results) and unstructured data (doctor notes).

**Questions:**

- What feature extraction techniques would be most effective in dealing with both structured and unstructured data in healthcare?
- How would you decide which features are most relevant to reduce noise without losing valuable information?

**Coding Task:**

Write a function that takes structured numerical data and text data as input and returns a processed feature set using basic feature extraction techniques.

## Version 3: Finance – Fraud Detection System

You are responsible for deploying a real-time machine learning pipeline that flags fraudulent credit card transactions. The pipeline must be capable of processing incoming transaction data with minimal latency.

You need to establish CI/CD practices to ensure updates to the model don’t disrupt real-time monitoring.

**Questions:**

- What are the key considerations when deploying a real-time fraud detection model, particularly in terms of speed, accuracy, and reliability?

- How would you ensure the system’s resilience to changes in data distribution or feature drift post-deployment?

**Coding Task:**

- Write a script that simulates the deployment of a simple model for real-time inference using a Flask API.

## Version 4: Logistics – Predictive Maintenance for Fleet Management

You’re tasked with setting up a monitoring system for a machine learning pipeline that predicts maintenance needs for delivery vehicles. The pipeline ingests sensor data from the vehicles in real-time and uses predictive models to recommend maintenance before failures occur.
The system must be able to adapt to varying data inputs and changing environmental conditions.

**Questions:**

- What monitoring tools or techniques would you use to ensure the model is performing optimally as vehicle usage data changes?

- How would you approach retraining the model to maintain high performance without manual intervention?

**Coding Task:**

Implement a function that simulates tracking a model's prediction accuracy over time and triggers an alert when performance drops below a threshold.

## Version 5: Technology – User Recommendation System for a Streaming Platform

Your team is developing a pipeline for a recommendation system that suggests content to users based on viewing history, preferences, and engagement data.
The pipeline should be capable of scaling to millions of users and handling significant traffic spikes during peak hours.

**Questions:**

- What strategies would you implement to ensure the pipeline can scale efficiently as the user base grows?

- How would you balance the trade-off between real-time processing capabilities and resource optimization, especially during peak loads?

**Coding Task:**

Create a script that simulates parallel processing of user data using Python's multiprocessing library to showcase how to handle a large number of requests.

# Constraints

- Assume data can vary greatly in structure and volume across these domains.
- The pipelines must be adaptable for potential changes in the data environment or shifts in business requirements.

# Notes

- Include questions that push the thought process toward anticipating and mitigating real-world challenges.
- Focus on approaches and strategic thinking rather than step-by-step implementations.
