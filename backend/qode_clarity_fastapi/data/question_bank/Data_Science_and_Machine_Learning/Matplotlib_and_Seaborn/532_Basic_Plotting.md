# Problem Description

Imagine you have a big set of data, like the scores of all the students in your class on a math test, and you want to understand it better. You could look at all the numbers, but that might be confusing. Instead, you can use pictures to help you see patterns more clearly.

Basic plotting is like turning your data into pictures. In this case, we use two tools called Matplotlib and Seaborn to make charts and graphs. These tools let you create things like:

Bar charts to compare different groups of data (like the test scores of different students).
Line graphs to show how something changes over time (like how the temperature changes during the day).
Histograms to show the spread of data (like how many students got different score ranges).
These types of visualizations help you understand the story behind the numbers. For example, with a bar chart, you can easily see which student did the best, or with a line graph, you can see if the temperature is going up or down.

In this lesson, you'll learn how to use Matplotlib and Seaborn to create these pictures, so you can make sense of data and tell its story in a simple and clear way.

# Versions

## Version 1: Line and Scatter Plots

### Scenario

You need to visualize the monthly sales trend of a product over the past year. Create basic line and scatter plots to show trends and specific data points.

### Learning Objectives

- Understand the basic structure of Matplotlib plots
- Learn to create and customize simple visualizations
- Master the fundamental plotting functions

### Questions

1. What is the difference between a line plot and a scatter plot?
2. When should each type of plot be used?
3. How do you customize the appearance of basic plots?
4. What are the essential components of a well-designed plot?
5. How do you save plots in different file formats?

### Coding Tasks

1. Create a basic line plot:

   - Plot monthly sales data
   - Add appropriate labels and title
   - Customize line color and style
   - Add grid lines

2. Create a scatter plot:

   - Plot sales vs. marketing spend
   - Add trend line
   - Customize marker styles
   - Include error bars

3. Combine line and scatter plots:
   - Overlay scatter points on trend line
   - Highlight significant points
   - Add legend
   - Implement proper scaling

## Version 2: Bar and Histogram Plots

### Scenario

Your team wants to compare the performance of various products using bar plots and understand the distribution of sales using histograms.

### Learning Objectives

- Master different types of bar plots
- Understand data distribution visualization
- Learn to create effective comparisons

### Questions

1. How do you create grouped bar plots using Seaborn?
2. What are the best practices for labeling axes and adding titles?
3. When should you use stacked vs. grouped bar charts?
4. How do you determine optimal bin sizes for histograms?
5. What are the advantages of kernel density plots?

### Coding Tasks

1. Create bar plots:

   - Simple vertical bars
   - Grouped bars by category
   - Stacked bars
   - Add value labels

2. Create histograms:

   - Plot sales distribution
   - Adjust bin sizes
   - Add kernel density estimate
   - Compare multiple distributions

3. Implement advanced features:
   - Error bars
   - Custom color palettes
   - Rotated labels
   - Secondary axis

## Version 3: Custom Legends and Annotations

### Scenario

A business report requires the addition of clear annotations on plots to emphasize key data points and ensure stakeholders can interpret the data correctly.

### Learning Objectives

- Master legend customization
- Learn effective annotation techniques
- Understand text positioning and formatting

### Questions

1. How do you add annotations in Matplotlib?
2. What are the best practices for legend placement?
3. How do you format text elements effectively?
4. When should you use arrows and text boxes?
5. How do you handle overlapping annotations?

### Coding Tasks

1. Add custom legends:

   - Multiple legend entries
   - Custom positioning
   - Formatted text
   - Legend box styling

2. Implement annotations:

   - Text labels
   - Arrow annotations
   - Highlight regions
   - Statistical annotations

3. Create professional finishing:
   - Title and subtitle
   - Source attribution
   - Date stamp
   - Custom formatting

# Constraints

- Ensure compatibility with standard libraries (Matplotlib 3.3+ and Seaborn 0.11+)
- Plots should be labeled clearly for presentation to a general audience
- Consider resolution and size for different display mediums
- Maintain simplicity and clarity

# Notes

- Use default color schemes unless specified otherwise
- Keep the code simple and beginner-friendly
- Test plots with different data sizes
- Consider printing requirements
- Document all customization steps
