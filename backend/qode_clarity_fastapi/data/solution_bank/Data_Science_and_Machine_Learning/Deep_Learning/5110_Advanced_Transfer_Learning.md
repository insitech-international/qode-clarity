# Problem Description

Imagine you're a research scientist at an AI lab tasked with developing cutting-edge transfer learning techniques for scenarios where traditional transfer learning approaches fail. Your challenge is to develop advanced methods that can transfer knowledge across drastically different domains, handle extreme data scarcity, and adapt to entirely new tasks with minimal or no labeled data.

Think of it like teaching a polymath who must quickly master entirely new fields. Just as a polymath can apply abstract principles from one domain to accelerate learning in another, your system needs to identify and transfer fundamental patterns and principles across seemingly unrelated domains.

# Versions

## Version 1: Cross-Modal Transfer Scenario
You're developing a system that must transfer knowledge between entirely different modalities (e.g., from text to images, or from audio to video). Create a framework that can identify and map abstract patterns across these different representations while maintaining semantic consistency.

## Version 2: Zero-Shot Domain Adaptation Scenario
You're building a system that must adapt to new domains without any labeled examples. Design a transfer learning approach that can leverage domain-invariant features and abstract knowledge to perform well on previously unseen domains.

## Version 3: Lifelong Transfer Learning Scenario
You're creating a system that continuously adapts to new tasks while maintaining performance on previous ones. Implement a transfer learning framework that enables progressive knowledge accumulation without catastrophic forgetting.

## Version 4: Meta-Transfer Learning Scenario
You're developing a system that learns how to transfer knowledge effectively across different types of tasks. Design a meta-learning framework that can automatically discover optimal transfer strategies for new domains and tasks.
