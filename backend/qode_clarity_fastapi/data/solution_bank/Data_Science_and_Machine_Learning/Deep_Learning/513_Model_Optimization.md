# Problem Description

Imagine you're leading an AI team at a major e-commerce platform. Your recommendation system, while functional, is consuming excessive computational resources and responding slower than desired. The challenge is to optimize the model's performance without significantly compromising its accuracy.

Think of it like tuning a high-performance race car. Just as a race car needs the right balance of speed, fuel efficiency, and handling, your model needs to balance accuracy, speed, and resource utilization. You need to fine-tune various components - from the engine (model architecture) to the fuel mixture (hyperparameters) - to achieve optimal performance.

# Versions

## Version 1: Inference Optimization Scenario
You're deploying a computer vision model for real-time quality control in a manufacturing plant. The model needs to process 100 images per second while maintaining 99% accuracy. Current performance is at 40 images per second. Optimize the model for inference speed while maintaining accuracy requirements.

## Version 2: Memory Optimization Scenario
You've built a large language model for a mobile app. The model uses 4GB of RAM, but mobile devices are limited to 2GB. Optimize the model to run within memory constraints while preserving core functionality.

## Version 3: Training Speed Optimization Scenario
Your team trains multiple versions of a recommendation model daily. Each training cycle takes 12 hours, causing bottlenecks in development. Optimize the training pipeline to reduce training time while maintaining model quality.

## Version 4: Multi-Device Optimization Scenario
You're deploying a facial recognition system across different hardware platforms - from edge devices to cloud servers. Create an optimization strategy that adapts the model's performance characteristics to each platform's capabilities.
