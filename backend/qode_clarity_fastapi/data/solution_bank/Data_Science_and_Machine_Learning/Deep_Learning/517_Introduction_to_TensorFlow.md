# Problem Description

Imagine you're a software engineer tasked with building and deploying machine learning models in a production environment. You need to understand TensorFlow's static computational graphs and eager execution to create scalable and efficient deep learning solutions.

Think of it like designing an assembly line for a factory. Just as an assembly line needs careful planning and optimization for efficient production, TensorFlow requires understanding of its computational model for building efficient deep learning systems.

# Versions

## Version 1: Graph Construction Scenario
You're building a production-ready image classification system. Design and implement a TensorFlow computational graph that efficiently handles preprocessing, model inference, and post-processing.

## Version 2: Keras Integration Scenario
You're developing a quick prototype of a natural language processing model. Use TensorFlow's Keras API to rapidly build and iterate on different model architectures.

## Version 3: Custom Training Scenario
You're implementing a specialized training loop with custom metrics and callbacks. Create a training system using TensorFlow's low-level APIs while maintaining efficient execution.
