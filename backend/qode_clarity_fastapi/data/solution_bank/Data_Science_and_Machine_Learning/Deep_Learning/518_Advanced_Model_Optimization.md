# Problem Description

Imagine you're leading an AI research team developing next-generation models that must run efficiently across a wide range of devices, from powerful servers to resource-constrained edge devices. Your challenge is to develop advanced optimization techniques that push the boundaries of model efficiency.

Think of it like designing a hybrid vehicle engine. Just as a hybrid engine must optimize between different power sources and efficiency modes, your optimization system must balance multiple competing objectives across different operational conditions.

# Versions

## Version 1: Neural Architecture Search Scenario
You're developing a system that automatically discovers optimal model architectures for specific tasks and hardware constraints. Implement an efficient search strategy that balances exploration and exploitation.

## Version 2: Hardware-Aware Optimization Scenario
You're optimizing models for deployment across different hardware accelerators (CPU, GPU, TPU). Create an optimization pipeline that adapts models to maximize performance on each platform.

## Version 3: Dynamic Optimization Scenario
You're building a system that dynamically adjusts model complexity based on available resources and performance requirements. Implement an adaptive optimization strategy.

## Version 4: Multi-Objective Optimization Scenario
You're optimizing a model for multiple competing objectives: accuracy, latency, memory usage, and energy consumption. Design an optimization approach that finds optimal trade-offs.
