# Problem Description

Imagine you're a machine learning engineer at a startup that needs to make its AI models accessible to other teams and services. Your challenge is to create robust, scalable web APIs using Flask that can serve machine learning models in production while handling various real-world challenges like concurrent requests, error handling, and monitoring.

Think of it like running a professional kitchen's order system. Just as a kitchen needs an efficient system to receive orders, process them correctly, and deliver results reliably, your Flask API needs to handle requests, process them through your ML model, and return predictions dependably.

# Versions

## Version 1: Basic Model Serving Scenario
You're deploying a simple image classification model. Create a Flask API that handles image uploads, preprocesses them, runs inference, and returns predictions with proper error handling and input validation.

## Version 2: High-Performance Serving Scenario
You're serving a high-traffic recommendation model that needs to handle 1000 requests per second. Design a Flask application that implements caching, batch processing, and asynchronous processing for optimal performance.

## Version 3: Multi-Model Serving Scenario
You're managing multiple versions of different models that need to be served simultaneously. Create a Flask application that handles model versioning, A/B testing, and dynamic model loading.

## Version 4: Real-time Serving Scenario
You're deploying a real-time fraud detection system that needs to process streaming data. Implement a Flask application that handles streaming inputs, maintains model state, and provides real-time predictions.

# Constraints

- Handle concurrent requests efficiently
- Implement proper error handling

# Notes

- Consider scalability requirements
- Implement proper security measures
- Use appropriate serialization
- Consider performance optimization
- Implement proper logging
- Use appropriate error handling
- Consider monitoring needs
- Implement proper testing
- Use appropriate deployment strategies
- Consider maintenance requirements
