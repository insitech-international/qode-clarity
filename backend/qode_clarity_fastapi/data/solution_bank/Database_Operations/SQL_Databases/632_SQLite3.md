# Problem Description

SQLite is a lightweight, file-based relational database management system (RDBMS) that is widely used for local data storage in applications. It provides a simple and efficient way to store and retrieve structured data without the need for a separate database server. SQLite is self-contained, serverless, and requires minimal configuration, making it an ideal choice for embedded systems, mobile apps, and desktop applications.

In the context of your code clarity project, integrating SQLite can provide a convenient and portable solution for storing and managing data locally. By leveraging SQLite's simplicity and the built-in `sqlite3` module in Python, you can easily create, query, and manipulate databases, ensuring data persistence and enabling offline functionality in your applications.

# Versions

## Version 1. Database Creation and Table Management

Create a new SQLite database and manage tables using the `sqlite3` module:

- Import the `sqlite3` module and establish a connection to an SQLite database file
- Create tables using SQL `CREATE TABLE` statements
- Define table schemas with appropriate column names, data types, and constraints
- Execute SQL statements to create, alter, or drop tables

## Version 2. Data Insertion and Retrieval

Insert and retrieve data from SQLite tables using SQL statements:

- Use SQL `INSERT` statements to insert new records into tables
- Retrieve data from tables using SQL `SELECT` statements
- Filter and sort results using `WHERE` and `ORDER BY` clauses
- Use placeholders and parameter substitution to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities

## Version 3. Data Manipulation and Transactions

Update and delete data in SQLite tables and handle transactions:

- Use SQL `UPDATE` statements to modify existing records in tables
- Delete records from tables using SQL `DELETE` statements
- Perform batch updates and deletes efficiently
- Use transactions to ensure data consistency and handle rollbacks in case of errors

## Version 4. Querying and Aggregating Data

Perform advanced queries and data aggregation using SQLite:

- Use SQL `JOIN` clauses to combine data from multiple tables
- Perform aggregate functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, and `MAX`
- Use subqueries and derived tables for complex data retrieval scenarios
- Implement pagination and limit the number of results returned

## Version 5. Real-Life Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Task Management Application

You are developing a task management application that needs to store tasks, categories, and user assignments locally on the user's device. Your manager has asked you to use SQLite to create the database schema, handle data persistence, and implement features like task creation, assignment, and tracking.

**Questions:**

1. How would you design the database schema to store tasks, categories, and user assignments?
2. What strategies would you employ to efficiently query and retrieve tasks based on various criteria?
3. How would you handle data synchronization and potential conflicts when multiple users access the same database file?

### Scenario 2: Offline Data Collection

You are working on a data collection application that needs to function offline in remote areas with limited connectivity. Your task is to use SQLite to store collected data locally on the device and synchronize it with a central database when a connection is available.

**Questions:**

1. How would you design the database schema to store collected data efficiently?
2. What strategies would you employ to ensure data integrity and prevent data loss during offline operation?
3. How would you handle data synchronization and conflict resolution when uploading collected data to the central database?

### Scenario 3: Configuration Management System

You are building a configuration management system for a desktop application. Your manager has requested that you use SQLite to store application settings, user preferences, and configuration data locally on the user's machine.

**Questions:**

1. How would you design the database schema to store various types of configuration data?
2. What strategies would you employ to efficiently retrieve and update configuration settings?
3. How would you handle versioning and backward compatibility of the configuration database across different application versions?

# Constraints

1. Ensure proper handling of database connections and cursors.
2. Use parameterized queries and placeholders to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
3. Handle database errors and exceptions gracefully, providing meaningful error messages.
4. Implement proper transaction management, including commit and rollback operations.
5. Optimize queries and database operations for performance, considering indexing and query planning.
6. Ensure data integrity and consistency by enforcing constraints and validations.
7. Implement proper error handling and logging for database operations.
8. Consider concurrency and potential conflicts when multiple processes or threads access the same database file.
9. Follow best practices for database schema design and normalization.
10. Ensure compatibility with the latest versions of SQLite and the `sqlite3` module in Python.

# Notes

- Use the built-in `sqlite3` module in Python to interact with SQLite databases.
- Establish a connection to an SQLite database file using `sqlite3.connect()`.
- Create a cursor object using the `connection.cursor()` method to execute SQL statements.
- Use SQL statements like `CREATE TABLE`, `INSERT`, `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` to manage and manipulate data in SQLite tables.
- Use placeholders (e.g., `?`) and parameter substitution to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- Commit transactions using the `connection.commit()` method or roll back using `connection.rollback()` in case of errors.
- Handle database errors and exceptions using try-except blocks and appropriate exception handling.
- Use SQL `JOIN` clauses to combine data from multiple tables and perform complex queries.
- Leverage SQLite's support for transactions to ensure data consistency and handle concurrent access.
- Use SQLite's built-in functions and aggregate functions for data analysis and reporting.
- Consider using SQLite extensions and libraries for additional functionality, such as full-text search and geospatial indexing.
- Follow SQLite best practices and conventions for database design, query optimization, and error handling.
