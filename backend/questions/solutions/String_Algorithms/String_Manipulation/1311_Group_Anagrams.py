        # CLASSIFICATION REASON:
        problem_classification="""
        This problem is classified as String Algorithm/String Manipulation because:
        1. It deals with anagrams, which are rearrangements of characters in strings.
        2. Core operations involve transforming strings through character counting.
        3. It utilizes mathematical concepts like combinatorics for string comparisons.
        
        This classification impacts our approach by focusing on efficient string manipulation techniques.

        # LOGIC EXPLANATION:
        real_world_relevance="""
Financial Analysis and Portfolio Management:
In portfolio management, counting smaller values to the right of self could be used to identify clusters of low-performing stocks within a portfolio.
For example, if we have a list of stock prices over time, we might want to count how many days had lower closing prices than today's price, to gauge overall market performance.

Healthcare and Biomedical Research:
In genomic analysis, this concept could be applied to studying gene expression levels along a chromosome.
Researchers might count how many base pairs downstream of a particular gene have lower expression levels, to identify regulatory elements.

Environmental Monitoring and Climate Science:
In climate data analysis, this could be used to study temperature trends over time.
Scientists might count how many consecutive years had lower average temperatures than the current year, to identify cooling trends.
These examples illustrate how counting smaller values to the right of self can be applied to various real-world scenarios:

Identifying patterns or trends in sequential data
Analyzing temporal changes in measurements
Spotting anomalies or significant deviations from recent norms
The core idea remains the same: we're looking at how many subsequent items in a sequence meet a certain condition (being smaller than the current item). This approach can be valuable in domains dealing with time-series data, sequential analysis, or identifying patterns in evolving systems.

        # BEST APPROACH:
        approach_selection="""
        The optimal approach uses character counting instead of sorting:
        1. It's more efficient, especially for longer strings.
        2. Avoids the computational cost of sorting each string.
        3. Creates a unique identifier for each anagram group based on character frequencies.

        Process:
        1. Iterate through each string in the input list.
        2. Count the frequency of each character in the string.
        3. Use this count as a key to group anagrams together.
        4. Return the grouped anagrams as a list of lists.
        
        Pseudocode:
        1. Initialize an empty dictionary to store anagram groups.
        2. For each string in the input list:
        a. Create a character count array of size 26 (for lowercase letters a-z).
        b. Iterate through each character in the string:
        - Increment the count for that character in the array.
        c. Convert the count array to a tuple to use as a dictionary key.
        d. If the key exists in the dictionary, append the current string to its list.
        e. If the key doesn't exist, create a new list with the current string.
        3. Return the values of the dictionary (lists of anagrams).

        # CONSTRAINTS:
       constraint_influence=""" 
        Constraints affecting our approach:
        1. Input size: Large inputs necessitate efficient algorithms.
        2. String length: Varying string lengths impact character counting strategy.
        
        These constraints shape our edge case management by:
        1. Ensuring the algorithm handles empty strings gracefully.
        2. Optimizing for both short and long strings in terms of memory usage.
        3. Considering case sensitivity and handling uppercase letters appropriately.
