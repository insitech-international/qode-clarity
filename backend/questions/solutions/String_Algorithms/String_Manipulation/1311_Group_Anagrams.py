        # CLASSIFICATION REASON:
        problem_classification="""
        This problem is classified as String Algorithm/String Manipulation because:
        1. It deals with anagrams, which are rearrangements of characters in strings.
        2. Core operations involve transforming strings through character counting.
        3. It utilizes mathematical concepts like combinatorics for string comparisons.
        
        This classification impacts our approach by focusing on efficient string manipulation techniques.

        # LOGIC EXPLANATION:
        real_world_relevance="""
        Anagrams are words or phrases formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase.
        For example, "bat" and "tab" are anagrams, as are "god" and "dog".
        The goal is to group all anagrams together from a given list of strings.

        Key Points:
        1. Two words are anagrams if they have the same characters with the same frequencies.
        2. The order of characters doesn't matter for anagrams.
        3. The task is to find all such groups and return them as lists.
        
        
        Anagram grouping is important in natural language processing because:
        1. It aids in spell checking and word suggestion algorithms.
        2. It's useful in text analysis for identifying related phrases.
        3. It helps in cryptography for potential plaintext identification.
        
        Understanding its complexity (O(n*m)) is crucial for optimizing performance,
        especially when dealing with large datasets of strings.
        
        Time Complexity: O(n * m)
        - n: Number of strings
        - m: Average length of strings
        
        Space Complexity: O(n * m)
        - Worst case: All strings stored in the dictionary
        
        This complexity is optimal because we must examine every character once.
        The space trade-off allows for efficient grouping without sorting.
        """,

        # BEST APPROACH:
        approach_selection="""
        The optimal approach uses character counting instead of sorting:
        1. It's more efficient, especially for longer strings.
        2. Avoids the computational cost of sorting each string.
        3. Creates a unique identifier for each anagram group based on character frequencies.

        Process:
        1. Iterate through each string in the input list.
        2. Count the frequency of each character in the string.
        3. Use this count as a key to group anagrams together.
        4. Return the grouped anagrams as a list of lists.
        
        Pseudocode:
        1. Initialize an empty dictionary to store anagram groups.
        2. For each string in the input list:
        a. Create a character count array of size 26 (for lowercase letters a-z).
        b. Iterate through each character in the string:
        - Increment the count for that character in the array.
        c. Convert the count array to a tuple to use as a dictionary key.
        d. If the key exists in the dictionary, append the current string to its list.
        e. If the key doesn't exist, create a new list with the current string.
        3. Return the values of the dictionary (lists of anagrams).

        # CONSTRAINTS:
       constraint_influence=""" 
        Constraints affecting our approach:
        1. Input size: Large inputs necessitate efficient algorithms.
        2. String length: Varying string lengths impact character counting strategy.
        
        These constraints shape our edge case management by:
        1. Ensuring the algorithm handles empty strings gracefully.
        2. Optimizing for both short and long strings in terms of memory usage.
        3. Considering case sensitivity and handling uppercase letters appropriately.
