    "scenario": "You are tasked with scheduling meetings in a limited number of conference rooms. Each meeting has a specific start and end time. To maximize the use of available rooms, you need to determine the maximum number of meetings that can be scheduled without overlapping. Your goal is to avoid scheduling conflicts and ensure efficient use of resources.",
