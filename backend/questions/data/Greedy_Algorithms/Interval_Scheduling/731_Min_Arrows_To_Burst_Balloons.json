    "scenario": "You are in charge of managing events at a festival where balloons are used as decorations. Each balloon has a specific start and end position (interval) where it can be displayed. To optimize the use of resources, you need to determine the minimum number of arrows required to pop all the balloons, where each arrow can burst all balloons that it passes through. This helps ensure the festival area remains clear and organized.",
    "task": "Create an algorithm that finds the minimum number of arrows needed to burst all balloons, given their start and end positions.",

            "explanation": "Two arrows are needed; one arrow can burst balloons at intervals [1,6] and [2,8], and another arrow can burst [10,16] and [7,12]."

            "output": 2,
            "explanation": "Two arrows can pop all balloons since the first arrow can burst [1,2] and [2,3], and the second arrow can burst [3,4] and [4,5]."
