    "scenario": "You are tasked with managing a gas station that serves multiple vehicles arriving at different times. Each vehicle has a specific fuel requirement and a time window within which it must be refueled. Your goal is to maximize the number of vehicles refueled in a given timeframe, ensuring efficient use of available pumps.",
    "task": "Develop a solution that schedules the refueling of vehicles in a way that maximizes the number of vehicles serviced without overlap in their refueling times.",

            "input": [
                {"vehicle": "Car A", "arrival": 1, "fuel_needed": 5},

            "output": ["Car A", "Car C", "Car D"],
            "explanation": "Car A arrives at time 1 and requires 5 units of fuel, so it starts being refueled. Car C arrives at time 4, which can be accommodated after Car A, while Car D can be refueled after Car C due to their time constraints."
