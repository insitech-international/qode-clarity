# Problem Description

Array operations are fundamental in data manipulation and numerical computing. NumPy's extensive set of array operations allows users to perform complex calculations efficiently. This problem set explores common and advanced array operations, emphasizing real-world applications.

# Versions

## Version 1: Basic Array Manipulations

### Scenario

A research lab needs help cleaning and organizing datasets for analysis. You need to create and manipulate NumPy arrays to meet their requirements.

### Learning Objectives

- Master array creation and initialization
- Understand array indexing and slicing
- Learn basic array transformations

### Questions

1. How do you create arrays with different initial values (zeros, ones, random)?
2. What are the common array operations (reshaping, slicing, indexing)?
3. How do you perform element-wise operations?
4. What are the differences between 1D, 2D, and 3D arrays?
5. How do you handle array data types and conversion?

### Coding Tasks

1. Array Creation and Initialization:

   ```python
   # Example skeleton
   def create_arrays():
       # Create arrays using different methods
       # Initialize with specific values
       # Generate random arrays
       pass
   ```

2. Basic Array Operations:

   ```python
   def array_operations(arr):
       # Reshape array
       # Slice specific elements
       # Perform basic arithmetic
       pass
   ```

3. Array Transformations:
   ```python
   def transform_arrays(arr):
       # Transpose
       # Flatten
       # Stack arrays
       pass
   ```

## Version 2: Array Broadcasting and Vectorized Operations

### Scenario

A financial company wants to apply calculations across entire datasets without using Python loops. Utilize NumPy's broadcasting and vectorized operations to achieve this.

### Learning Objectives

- Understand broadcasting rules
- Master vectorized operations
- Learn performance optimization techniques

### Questions

1. What is broadcasting in NumPy, and how does it work?
2. How do vectorized operations improve performance?
3. What are the rules for shape compatibility?
4. When should broadcasting be avoided?
5. How do you debug broadcasting errors?

### Coding Tasks

1. Broadcasting Operations:

   ```python
   def broadcast_operations():
       # Demonstrate broadcasting rules
       # Show shape compatibility
       # Handle mismatched dimensions
       pass
   ```

2. Vectorized Calculations:

   ```python
   def vectorized_calc(arr1, arr2):
       # Perform vectorized operations
       # Compare with loop-based approach
       # Measure performance
       pass
   ```

3. Advanced Broadcasting:
   ```python
   def advanced_broadcasting():
       # Multiple array broadcasting
       # Complex calculations
       # Optimization techniques
       pass
   ```

## Version 3: Advanced Indexing and Masking

### Scenario

An image processing task requires selecting and modifying specific parts of an array based on conditions. Use advanced indexing and masking to handle this.

### Learning Objectives

- Master boolean indexing
- Understand fancy indexing
- Learn complex selection techniques

### Questions

1. How can you use Boolean masks to filter array elements?
2. What is the difference between fancy indexing and slicing?
3. How do you combine different indexing methods?
4. What are the performance implications of different indexing approaches?
5. How do you handle multi-dimensional indexing?

### Coding Tasks

1. Boolean Masking:

   ```python
   def boolean_masking(arr):
       # Create boolean masks
       # Apply conditions
       # Modify selected elements
       pass
   ```

2. Fancy Indexing:

   ```python
   def fancy_indexing(arr):
       # Use integer arrays for indexing
       # Select multiple elements
       # Rearrange elements
       pass
   ```

3. Combined Indexing:
   ```python
   def combined_indexing(arr):
       # Mix different indexing methods
       # Handle complex selections
       # Optimize operations
       pass
   ```

# Constraints

- Ensure arrays are handled efficiently for large data sizes (10,000+ elements)
- Operations should minimize memory usage wherever possible
- Consider performance implications of different approaches
- Handle edge cases appropriately
