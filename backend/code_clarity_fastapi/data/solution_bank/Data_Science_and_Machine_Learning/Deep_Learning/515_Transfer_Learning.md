# Problem Description

Imagine you're working for a startup that needs to build specialized AI models but has limited labeled data and computing resources. Your challenge is to leverage existing pre-trained models and adapt them to new, specific tasks while maintaining high performance.

Think of it like adapting a seasoned chef to a new cuisine. Just as the chef can apply their fundamental cooking skills and knowledge to learn new dishes quickly, transfer learning allows models to apply their learned features to new but related tasks.

# Versions

## Version 1: Vision Transfer Scenario
You need to build a model that identifies rare plant diseases with only 100 labeled images per disease. Adapt a pre-trained vision model to achieve high accuracy with limited data.

## Version 2: Language Transfer Scenario
You're building a chatbot for a specialized medical domain. Adapt a general-purpose language model to understand and respond to medical queries while maintaining medical accuracy.

## Version 3: Cross-Domain Transfer Scenario
You need to create a model that converts speech to sign language animations. Design a transfer learning approach that bridges the gap between audio processing and motion generation.

## Version 4: Multi-Modal Transfer Scenario
You're building a system that must understand both images and text in a specialized technical domain. Design a transfer learning approach that leverages pre-trained models from both modalities.
