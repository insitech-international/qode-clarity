# Problem Description

You need to prepare your dataset for machine learning.

---

### Version 1: Feature Scaling

Your initial focus is on scaling features to improve model performance. You need to:

- Implement normalization and standardization techniques.
- Understand the impact of scaling on distance-based algorithms like KNN.

What are the key differences between normalization and standardization, and when should each be applied?

---

### Version 2: Categorical Encoding

You are tasked with encoding categorical variables for modeling. This includes:

- Applying one-hot encoding and label encoding to different types of categorical data.
- Evaluating the effects of these encodings on model performance.

What are the considerations to keep in mind when encoding categorical features?

---

### Version 3: Handling Outliers

You notice that your dataset contains several outliers. Your responsibilities involve:

- Identifying outliers using statistical methods.
- Deciding on strategies for handling outliers (removal, transformation, etc.).

How can outliers impact model performance, and what are effective methods for addressing them during preprocessing?
