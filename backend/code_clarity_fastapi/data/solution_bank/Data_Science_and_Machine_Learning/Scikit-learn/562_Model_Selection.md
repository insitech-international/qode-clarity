# Problem Description

You are tasked with selecting the best model for a predictive task.

---

### Version 1: Comparing Models

Imagine you have multiple models trained on the same dataset. Your responsibilities include:

- Evaluating and comparing models using a consistent set of metrics.
- Understanding the trade-offs between different algorithms (e.g., decision trees vs. support vector machines).

How can you effectively compare and select the best model based on empirical results?

---

### Version 2: Ensemble Methods

You decide to implement ensemble methods for improved performance. Your focus includes:

- Exploring techniques like bagging, boosting, and stacking.
- Understanding how ensemble methods can reduce variance and bias in model predictions.

What are the key principles behind ensemble methods, and when should you consider using them?

---

### Version 3: Domain-Specific Considerations

In your analysis, you realize that domain-specific knowledge is crucial. You must:

- Integrate domain knowledge into model selection processes.
- Evaluate models based on domain-specific performance criteria.

How can you ensure that your model selection process aligns with the specific needs of the business or domain you are working in?
