# Problem Description

You are required to evaluate the performance of various machine learning models.

---

### Version 1: Basic Evaluation Metrics

You need to evaluate your models using basic performance metrics. Your tasks include:

- Implementing accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for classification tasks.
- Understanding the ROC curve and AUC for model evaluation.

How do these metrics provide insights into model performance, and what considerations should be taken into account when interpreting them?

---

### Version 2: Cross-Validation Techniques

You decide to implement cross-validation to assess model robustness. Your focus should be on:

- Utilizing k-fold cross-validation to prevent overfitting.
- Implementing stratified sampling to maintain the distribution of classes.

What are the advantages of cross-validation compared to a simple train-test split, and how can it impact model selection?

---

### Version 3: Hyperparameter Tuning

To enhance model performance, you are tasked with hyperparameter tuning. This includes:

- Using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to find optimal parameters.
- Analyzing the trade-off between bias and variance during tuning.

What strategies can you employ to ensure effective hyperparameter optimization while avoiding overfitting?
