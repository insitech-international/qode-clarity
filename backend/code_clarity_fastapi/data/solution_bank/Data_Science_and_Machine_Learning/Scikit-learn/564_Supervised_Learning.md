# Problem Description

You are tasked with implementing supervised learning models for a classification problem.

---

### Version 1: Classification Algorithms

You need to evaluate various classification algorithms. Your tasks include:

- Comparing algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.
- Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm.

How do you decide which classification algorithm to use based on the problem characteristics?

---

### Version 2: Regression Techniques

In addition to classification, you also need to implement regression algorithms. This includes:

- Exploring linear regression, polynomial regression, and support vector regression.
- Analyzing performance metrics specific to regression tasks (e.g., RMSE, RÂ²).

What factors influence the choice of regression technique, and how do you evaluate model performance in regression problems?

### Version 3: Advanced Supervised Learning

You are tasked with implementing advanced supervised learning techniques. This includes:

- Using techniques like feature engineering and selection to enhance model performance.
- Implementing cross-validation to ensure generalizability of the model.

What are the critical steps in developing a robust supervised learning model, and how do you evaluate its success?
