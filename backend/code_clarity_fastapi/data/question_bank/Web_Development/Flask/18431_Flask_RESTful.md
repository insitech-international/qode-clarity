## Problem Description

Flask-RESTful is an extension for Flask that simplifies the creation of RESTful APIs. This problem focuses on designing and implementing effective RESTful APIs using Flask-RESTful for various application scenarios, including resource representation, request parsing, and response formatting.

## Versions

### Version 1: Basic Resource Implementation

Create a basic RESTful resource for a simple entity.

Task: Implement CRUD operations for a 'User' resource using Flask-RESTful.

### Version 2: Nested Resources

Design and implement nested resources for related entities.

Task: Create resources for a blogging platform, including posts and comments as nested resources.

### Version 3: Custom Authentication

Develop a custom authentication mechanism for API access.

Task: Implement token-based authentication for API resources, including token generation and validation.

### Version 4: Real-Life Domain Cases

#### Scenario 1: Library Management System
Design a RESTful API for a library management system.

Task:
a) Create resources for books, including search and availability status.
b) Implement borrowing and returning processes as API operations.
c) Develop resources for managing library members and their borrowing history.

#### Scenario 2: Restaurant Order Management
Implement a RESTful API for a restaurant order management system.

Task:
a) Create resources for menu items, including categorization and customization options.
b) Develop order placement and tracking resources.
c) Implement resources for managing tables and reservations.

#### Scenario 3: Fitness Tracking Application
Design a RESTful API for a fitness tracking application.

Task:
a) Create resources for tracking various types of workouts and activities.
b) Implement resources for setting and tracking fitness goals.
c) Develop resources for nutritional tracking and meal planning.

#### Scenario 4: Project Management Tool
Implement a RESTful API for a project management application.

Task:
a) Create resources for projects, tasks, and subtasks.
b) Develop resources for team member management and task assignments.
c) Implement resources for time tracking and project analytics.

#### Scenario 5: E-learning Platform
Design a RESTful API for an e-learning platform.

Task:
a) Create resources for courses, lessons, and quizzes.
b) Implement resources for student enrollment and progress tracking.
c) Develop resources for instructor management and content creation.

## Constraints

- Ensure proper use of HTTP methods and status codes.
- Implement appropriate request parsing and input validation.
- Design efficient data serialization and deserialization methods.
- Consider pagination for resources that may return large datasets.
- Implement proper error handling and informative error messages.

## Notes

- Utilize Flask-RESTful's Resource class for organizing your API endpoints.
- Make use of request parsing capabilities provided by Flask-RESTful for handling input data.
- Consider using Marshmallow for more complex serialization and deserialization needs.
- Implement proper authentication and authorization checks for protected resources.
- Use Flask-RESTful's built-in support for content negotiation and response formatting.
- Consider implementing API versioning to manage future changes and updates.
