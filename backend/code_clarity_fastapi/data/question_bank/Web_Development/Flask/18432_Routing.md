## Problem Description

Flask routing is the mechanism by which Flask maps URLs to specific functions in your application. This problem focuses on designing and implementing effective routing strategies for various web application scenarios, including handling different HTTP methods, URL parameters, and organizing complex application structures.

## Versions

### Version 1: Basic URL Routing

Implement basic URL routing for a simple web application.

Task: Create routes for home, about, and contact pages, including handling form submissions.

### Version 2: Dynamic Routes

Design routes with dynamic parameters to handle variable content.

Task: Implement a blog system with routes for viewing posts by ID, category, and author.

### Version 3: RESTful Resource Routing

Develop a RESTful routing structure for a resource.

Task: Create routes for CRUD operations on a 'Product' resource, following RESTful conventions.

### Version 4: Real-Life Domain Cases

#### Scenario 1: E-commerce Platform
Design a routing system for an e-commerce platform.

Task:
a) Create routes for product listings, including category and search result pages.
b) Implement routes for user account management (registration, login, profile).
c) Develop routes for shopping cart and checkout processes.

#### Scenario 2: Content Management System
Implement a routing system for a flexible content management system.

Task:
a) Create routes for different types of content (articles, pages, media).
b) Implement an admin interface with routes for content creation and management.
c) Develop a routing strategy for handling custom page structures and hierarchies.

#### Scenario 3: Social Media Application
Design routes for a social media application.

Task:
a) Create routes for user profiles, including customizable usernames in URLs.
b) Implement routes for posting, commenting, and liking functionality.
c) Develop routes for direct messaging and notification systems.

#### Scenario 4: Educational Platform
Implement a routing system for an online learning platform.

Task:
a) Create routes for course listings, individual lessons, and quizzes.
b) Implement routes for student progress tracking and certifications.
c) Develop routes for instructor dashboards and content management.

#### Scenario 5: API Gateway
Design a routing system for an API gateway service.

Task:
a) Create routes for proxying requests to different microservices.
b) Implement routes for API key management and usage tracking.
c) Develop routes for API documentation and interactive testing interfaces.

## Constraints

- Ensure routes are logical, memorable, and follow web conventions.
- Implement proper handling of different HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) for each route.
- Consider URL parameter validation and type conversion where necessary.
- Design routes with scalability in mind, allowing for future expansion of functionality.
- Implement proper error handling, including 404 and 500 error routes.

## Notes

- Utilize Flask's `@app.route()` decorator for defining routes.
- Consider using Flask's Blueprints for organizing routes in larger applications.
- Implement URL generation using `url_for()` to maintain flexibility in your routing structure.
- Be mindful of route order, as Flask matches routes in the order they are defined.
- Use converters in route definitions to automatically handle type conversion of URL parameters.
- Consider implementing before and after request handlers for common operations across routes.
