## Problem Description

Django REST Framework (DRF) is a powerful toolkit for building Web APIs with Django. It provides a set of tools for serialization, authentication, viewsets, and more. This problem focuses on designing and implementing effective RESTful APIs using DRF for various application scenarios.

## Versions

### Version 1: Basic API Design

Design a basic RESTful API for a library management system.

Task: Create API endpoints for books and authors, including listing, retrieval, creation, updating, and deletion.

### Version 2: Advanced Serialization

Implement complex serialization logic for a social media platform.

Task: Design serializers for user profiles, posts, and comments, handling nested relationships and custom field representations.

### Version 3: Custom Authentication

Develop a custom authentication scheme for a multi-tenant SaaS application.

Task: Implement a token-based authentication system with tenant-specific permissions and rate limiting.

### Version 4: Real-Life Domain Cases

#### Scenario 1: E-commerce Platform API
Design a comprehensive API for an e-commerce platform.

Task:
a) Create endpoints for product catalog management, including categories and variations.
b) Implement order processing APIs, including cart management and checkout.
c) Develop APIs for user reviews and ratings, with moderation capabilities.

#### Scenario 2: Health and Fitness Tracking API
Design APIs for a health and fitness tracking application.

Task:
a) Create endpoints for user activity logging (steps, workouts, sleep).
b) Implement APIs for dietary tracking and nutritional analysis.
c) Develop endpoints for goal setting and progress tracking.

#### Scenario 3: Real-time Collaborative Tool API
Design APIs for a real-time collaborative project management tool.

Task:
a) Create endpoints for project and task management with real-time updates.
b) Implement APIs for user collaboration features (comments, file sharing).
c) Develop endpoints for activity feeds and notifications.

#### Scenario 4: IoT Device Management Platform
Design APIs for an IoT device management platform.

Task:
a) Create endpoints for device registration, configuration, and monitoring.
b) Implement APIs for data ingestion from devices and data querying.
c) Develop endpoints for firmware updates and remote device control.

#### Scenario 5: Content Delivery API
Design APIs for a content delivery and management system.

Task:
a) Create endpoints for content creation, scheduling, and distribution.
b) Implement APIs for content personalization and recommendation.
c) Develop endpoints for analytics and performance tracking of content.

## Constraints

- Ensure proper use of HTTP methods and status codes.
- Implement appropriate authentication and permission checks.
- Consider versioning strategies for the API.
- Optimize for performance, especially for endpoints dealing with large datasets.
- Implement proper error handling and informative error messages.

## Notes

- Utilize DRF's viewsets and routers for efficient API design.
- Consider using nested routers for handling complex relationships.
- Implement proper filtering, sorting, and pagination for list endpoints.
- Use serializer validation for input data sanitization and validation.
- Consider implementing caching strategies for frequently accessed data.
- Be mindful of the implications of your API design on client applications.
