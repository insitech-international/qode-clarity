## Problem Description

FastAPI path operations define how your API handles different HTTP methods and URLs. This problem focuses on designing and implementing effective path operations for various API scenarios, including proper request handling, response modeling, and API documentation.

## Versions

### Version 1: Basic CRUD Operations

Design path operations for basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.

Task: Create path operations for managing a simple resource, such as a to-do list item.

### Version 2: Complex Query Parameters

Implement path operations that handle complex query parameters for filtering and sorting.

Task: Design an endpoint that allows searching and filtering a large dataset with multiple optional parameters.

### Version 3: File Upload and Download

Develop path operations for handling file uploads and downloads.

Task: Create endpoints for uploading images, generating thumbnails, and serving different image sizes.

### Version 4: Real-Life Domain Cases

#### Scenario 1: E-commerce Product Catalog

Design path operations for a comprehensive e-commerce product catalog API.

Task:
a) Create endpoints for listing products with category and brand filtering.
b) Implement a search endpoint with faceted search capabilities.
c) Develop endpoints for managing product variations and inventory.

#### Scenario 2: Social Media Post Management

Implement path operations for a social media platform's post management system.

Task:
a) Design endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting posts.
b) Create an endpoint for retrieving a user's feed with pagination.
c) Implement endpoints for post interactions (likes, comments, shares).

#### Scenario 3: IoT Device Data Ingestion

Develop path operations for an IoT platform that ingests and queries device data.

Task:
a) Create endpoints for devices to submit telemetry data.
b) Implement query endpoints for retrieving historical device data with time-range filtering.
c) Design endpoints for managing device metadata and configurations.

#### Scenario 4: Financial Transaction API

Design path operations for a financial transaction processing system.

Task:
a) Implement endpoints for initiating various types of financial transactions.
b) Create endpoints for retrieving transaction history with advanced filtering.
c) Develop endpoints for generating financial reports and summaries.

#### Scenario 5: Health Records Management

Create path operations for a health records management system.

Task:
a) Design endpoints for managing patient records, including medical history and test results.
b) Implement endpoints for scheduling and managing appointments.
c) Create endpoints for secure sharing of medical records between healthcare providers.

## Constraints

- Ensure proper use of HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) for each operation.
- Implement appropriate status codes and error responses.
- Design path operations with security in mind, including proper authentication and authorization checks.
- Optimize for performance, especially for operations that might handle large amounts of data.

## Notes

- Utilize FastAPI's path operation decorators (@app.get(), @app.post(), etc.) for clear and concise endpoint definitions.
- Make use of Pydantic models for request body validation and response modeling.
- Implement proper input validation using query parameters, path parameters, and request bodies.
- Use FastAPI's automatic API documentation features to provide clear and comprehensive API documentation.
- Consider versioning strategies for your API to manage future changes and updates.
- Implement proper exception handling to provide meaningful error messages to API consumers.
