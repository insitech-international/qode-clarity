# Problem Description

FastAPI's dependency injection system allows you to declare function parameters that should be filled by external dependencies. This problem focuses on effectively using dependency injection in FastAPI to create modular, testable, and efficient web applications.

# Versions

## Version 1: Basic Dependency Injection

Implement basic dependency injection for a user authentication system.

Task: Create a dependency that retrieves the current user from a request header or token.

## Version 2: Database Connections

Use dependency injection to manage database connections in a FastAPI application.

Task: Implement a dependency that provides a database session for each request, ensuring proper connection management.

## Version 3: Caching Layer

Develop a caching system using dependency injection.

Task: Create a dependency that provides a caching mechanism, allowing endpoints to easily cache and retrieve data.

## Version 4: Real-Life Domain Cases

### Scenario 1: Multi-tenant SaaS Application

Design a dependency injection system for a multi-tenant SaaS platform.

Task:
a) Create a dependency that determines the current tenant based on the request.
b) Implement a dependency that provides tenant-specific configuration settings.
c) Develop a dependency for tenant-specific database selection and connection.

### Scenario 2: API Rate Limiting

Implement a rate limiting system using dependency injection.

Task:
a) Create a dependency that tracks and limits API requests per user or IP.
b) Implement a dependency that provides different rate limit tiers based on user roles.
c) Develop a dependency for dynamic rate limit adjustment based on server load.

### Scenario 3: Internationalization and Localization

Design a language and localization system using dependency injection.

Task:
a) Create a dependency that determines the user's preferred language from headers or user settings.
b) Implement a dependency that provides translated strings based on the determined language.
c) Develop a dependency for handling locale-specific formatting (dates, numbers, etc.).

### Scenario 4: Feature Flagging System

Implement a feature flagging system using dependency injection.

Task:
a) Create a dependency that checks if a feature is enabled for the current user or environment.
b) Implement a dependency that provides feature-specific configuration when a flag is enabled.
c) Develop a dependency for gradual feature rollout based on user segments.

### Scenario 5: Logging and Monitoring

Design a comprehensive logging and monitoring system using dependency injection.

Task:
a) Create a dependency that provides a context-aware logger for each request.
b) Implement a dependency for tracking request durations and system metrics.
c) Develop a dependency for error reporting and alerting based on certain conditions.

# Constraints

- Ensure that dependencies are efficiently resolved and do not impact performance significantly.
- Consider the scope of dependencies (request-level, app-level) and manage their lifecycle appropriately.
- Implement proper error handling within dependencies.
- Ensure that the dependency injection system doesn't lead to circular dependencies.

# Notes

- Use FastAPI's Depends class to declare dependencies in endpoint function parameters.
- Consider using dependency classes for more complex dependencies that require initialization.
- Utilize dependency overrides for testing to replace real dependencies with mocks or stubs.
- Be mindful of the order of execution for multiple dependencies in a single endpoint.
- Use yield dependencies for resources that need cleanup after the request is processed.
- Consider the impact of dependencies on API documentation and how they're represented in OpenAPI schemas.
