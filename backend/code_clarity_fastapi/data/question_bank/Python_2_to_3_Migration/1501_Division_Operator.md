# Problem Description

In the migration from Python 2 to Python 3, one of the most significant changes was the behavior of the division operator (/). This problem focuses on understanding and adapting to this change in various contexts.

# Versions

## Version 1: Basic Division Operator Change

In Python 2, the / operator performs floor division between two integers. In Python 3, it performs true division.

Example:

- Python 2: 5 / 2 = 2
- Python 3: 5 / 2 = 2.5

Task: Convert a Python 2 script that relies on integer division to work correctly in Python 3.

## Version 2: Mixed Operand Types

Consider scenarios where division involves different numeric types (int, float, complex).

Example:

- Python 2: 5 / 2.0 = 2.5, 5 / 2 = 2
- Python 3: 5 / 2.0 = 2.5, 5 / 2 = 2.5

Task: Analyze and modify a complex calculation involving mixed operand types to ensure consistent behavior in Python 3.

## Version 3: Division in List Comprehensions and Generators

Examine how the division change affects list comprehensions and generators.

Example:

- Python 2: [i/2 for i in range(10)] produces [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4]
- Python 3: [i/2 for i in range(10)] produces [0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5]

Task: Refactor list comprehensions and generators that use division to maintain the desired behavior in Python 3.

## Version 4: Real-Life Domain Cases

### Scenario 1: Financial Calculations

In a financial application, divisions are used for various calculations like computing interest rates, asset allocations, and price-to-earnings ratios.

Task:
a) Modify a function that calculates compound interest to work correctly in Python 3.
b) Update a portfolio balancing algorithm that uses division for asset allocation.
c) Refactor a stock analysis tool that computes various financial ratios.

### Scenario 2: Scientific Computing

In scientific simulations, precise divisions are crucial for accurate results.

Task:
a) Update a physics simulation that calculates projectile motion using division.
b) Modify a chemistry program that computes molecular weights and stoichiometric ratios.
c) Refactor a climate model that uses division in various atmospheric calculations.

### Scenario 3: Data Analysis

Data analysis often involves divisions for normalization, averaging, and feature scaling.

Task:
a) Update a data normalization function to ensure correct scaling in Python 3.
b) Modify a moving average calculation in a time series analysis.
c) Refactor a machine learning preprocessing step that uses division for feature scaling.

### Scenario 4: Image Processing

Image processing algorithms often use division for scaling, color adjustments, and filter applications.

Task:
a) Update an image resizing function that uses division to calculate new dimensions.
b) Modify a color balance adjustment algorithm that involves division operations.
c) Refactor a convolution filter application that uses division for normalization.

### Scenario 5: Game Development

In game development, divisions are used for various calculations including physics simulations and scoring systems.

Task:
a) Update a physics engine that uses division for velocity and acceleration calculations.
b) Modify a scoring system that involves division for point allocation and normalization.
c) Refactor a procedural generation algorithm that uses division for terrain creation.

# Constraints

- Ensure backward compatibility with Python 2 if required.
- Consider performance implications of division operations, especially in computationally intensive tasks.
- Be aware of potential floating-point precision issues when migrating from integer division to float division.

# Notes

- The `//` operator can be used in both Python 2 and 3 for floor division.
- The `from __future__ import division` statement can be used in Python 2 to get Python 3 division behavior.
- Consider using type hints (Python 3.5+) to clarify expected types in division operations.
- Be cautious with divisions that could lead to zero division errors.
- In some cases, replacing division with multiplication by the reciprocal might be more efficient.
- For precise decimal calculations, consider using the `decimal` module instead of float division.
