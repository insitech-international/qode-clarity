# Problem Description

Supervised learning is a fundamental paradigm in machine learning where the goal is to learn a function that maps input features to corresponding output labels based on a labeled training dataset. It encompasses a wide range of techniques for both classification and regression tasks.

In real-world scenarios, supervised learning techniques are applied to solve various problems, such as predicting customer churn, forecasting sales, diagnosing diseases, and more. The choice of the appropriate supervised learning algorithm depends on the nature of the problem, the characteristics of the data, and the desired performance metrics.

# Versions

## Version 1: Customer Churn Prediction

Scenario:
You are working on a customer churn prediction project for a telecommunications company. The goal is to build a model that can predict whether a customer is likely to churn based on their demographic information, usage patterns, and other relevant features. The company wants to proactively identify potential churners and take preventive measures to retain them.

Questions:

1. What are the suitable supervised learning algorithms for the customer churn prediction task, such as logistic regression, decision trees, or random forests? How can their performance be compared?
2. How can the interpretability of the churn prediction model be ensured? What are the techniques for feature importance analysis and model explanation?
3. How can the model be evaluated to assess its performance on unseen data? What are the appropriate evaluation metrics for churn prediction, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score?

## Version 2: House Price Prediction

Scenario:
You are working on a house price prediction project for a real estate company. The goal is to develop a model that can estimate the price of a house based on its features, such as location, size, number of rooms, and amenities. The company wants to provide accurate price predictions to potential buyers and sellers.

Questions:

1. What are the suitable regression algorithms for house price prediction, such as linear regression, decision tree regression, or gradient boosting regression? How can their performance be compared?
2. How can the model handle categorical features, such as location or neighborhood? What are the encoding techniques for categorical variables in regression tasks?
3. What are the evaluation metrics for assessing the performance of the house price prediction model, such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, or R-squared?

## Version 3: Medical Diagnosis

Scenario:
You are working on a medical diagnosis project for a healthcare organization. The goal is to develop a model that can predict the presence of a specific disease based on patient symptoms, medical history, and test results. The model should assist healthcare professionals in making accurate diagnoses and treatment decisions.

Questions:

1. What are the suitable supervised learning algorithms for the medical diagnosis task, such as support vector machines, naive Bayes, or neural networks? How can their performance be compared?
2. How can the model handle imbalanced datasets, where the number of positive cases (patients with the disease) is significantly lower than the negative cases? What are the techniques for handling class imbalance?
3. How can the model's performance be evaluated in terms of sensitivity (recall), specificity, and area under the ROC curve? What are the considerations for setting the classification threshold in a medical diagnosis scenario?

# Constraints

1. How can the model be designed to handle missing or incomplete data in the customer churn dataset?
2. What are the computational constraints when training and deploying the house price prediction model on large-scale datasets?
3. How can the model be regularized to prevent overfitting, especially when dealing with high-dimensional medical data?
4. What are the privacy and security considerations when handling sensitive patient data in the medical diagnosis project?
5. How can the model be integrated into the existing systems and workflows of the telecommunications company for seamless churn prediction?

# Notes

1. What are the best practices for feature selection and engineering in the customer churn prediction task?
2. How can domain knowledge be incorporated into the feature engineering process for house price prediction?
3. What are the considerations for handling multi-class classification problems in the medical diagnosis scenario?
4. How can the model's performance be monitored and updated over time as new data becomes available?
5. What are the guidelines for communicating the model's predictions and limitations to stakeholders in each scenario?
