# Problem Description

Pandas DataFrame operations are essential for manipulating and analyzing data. This problem set explores basic to advanced DataFrame operations, such as merging, grouping, and pivoting.

# Versions

## Version 1: Basic DataFrame Operations

### Scenario

A startup needs quick insights from sales data, which requires you to perform basic DataFrame operations like filtering, sorting, and column manipulation.

### Learning Objectives

- Master basic DataFrame manipulation
- Understand indexing and selection
- Learn column operations

### Questions

1. How do you filter DataFrame rows effectively?
2. What are the best methods for column manipulation?
3. How do you handle multi-level indexing?
4. What are the different selection methods?
5. How do you optimize basic operations?

### Coding Tasks

1. Data Selection:

   ```python
   def select_data(df):
       # Filter rows
       # Select columns
       # Use boolean indexing
       pass
   ```

2. Column Operations:

   ```python
   def manipulate_columns(df):
       # Add/remove columns
       # Rename columns
       # Reorder columns
       pass
   ```

3. Index Operations:
   ```python
   def handle_indices(df):
       # Set/reset index
       # Handle multi-index
       # Sort by index
       pass
   ```

## Version 2: Merging and Joining DataFrames

### Scenario

A company is consolidating data from multiple sources into a single DataFrame for analysis. Use merging and joining techniques to combine data effectively.

### Learning Objectives

- Understand different join types
- Master merge operations
- Learn to handle key conflicts

### Questions

1. What is the difference between merge() and join()?
2. How do you handle different types of joins?
3. What are common key matching issues?
4. How do you validate merged results?
5. What are the performance considerations?

### Coding Tasks

1. Basic Merging:
   ```python
   def merge_dataframes(df1, df2):
       # Perform inner join
       # Handle outer join
       # Implement left/right joins
       pass
   ```
