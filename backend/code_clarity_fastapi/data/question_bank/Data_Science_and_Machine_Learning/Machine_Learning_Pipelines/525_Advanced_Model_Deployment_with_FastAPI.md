# Problem Description

Imagine you're a machine learning engineer at a high-growth startup that needs to serve ML models with maximum performance and minimal latency. Your challenge is to create high-performance APIs using FastAPI that can handle thousands of concurrent requests while maintaining reliability and monitoring capabilities.

Think of it like managing a high-speed automated fulfillment center. Just as the center needs to process thousands of orders simultaneously with high efficiency and accuracy, your FastAPI application needs to handle numerous concurrent requests while maintaining performance and reliability.

# Versions

## Version 1: High-Performance Serving Scenario
You're deploying a computer vision model that needs to process images in real-time. Create a FastAPI application that handles concurrent image processing requests with minimal latency.

## Version 2: Streaming Data Scenario
You're serving a natural language processing model that processes streaming text data. Design a FastAPI application that handles WebSocket connections and provides real-time predictions.

## Version 3: Multi-Model Serving Scenario
You're managing a suite of different models that need to be served through a single API. Implement a FastAPI application that handles model routing, versioning, and dynamic loading.

## Version 4: Batch Processing Scenario
You're deploying a recommendation system that needs to process batch requests efficiently. Create a FastAPI application that handles batch processing with proper resource management.

# Constraints

- Handle async operations efficiently
- Implement proper validation
- Support WebSocket connections
