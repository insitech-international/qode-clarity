# Problem Description

Consider the end-to-end development of a machine learning pipeline for a product recommendation system.

---

### Version 1: Data Ingestion

Your first task is to set up data ingestion. You must:

- Develop a strategy for collecting data from multiple sources (databases, APIs).
- Ensure data is preprocessed and cleaned before being passed to the model.

What approaches can you take to ensure efficient and scalable data ingestion?

---

### Version 2: Feature Engineering

After ingestion, your next responsibility involves feature engineering. You need to:

- Identify relevant features that contribute to the model's predictive power.
- Apply techniques for feature selection and dimensionality reduction.

How do you evaluate the effectiveness of your feature engineering techniques on model performance?

---

### Version 3: Model Deployment

Finally, you must deploy your machine learning model. Considerations include:

- Choosing between batch vs. real-time inference.
- Implementing continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) for your model.
- Monitoring model performance post-deployment.

What strategies can you implement to ensure that your model remains robust and performs well in a production environment?
