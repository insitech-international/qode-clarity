# Problem Description

Imagine you're the lead ML infrastructure engineer at a large enterprise that needs to serve complex ML models across multiple regions with high availability and scalability requirements. Your challenge is to create sophisticated Flask applications that can handle enterprise-scale deployment scenarios while maintaining security, monitoring, and maintenance capabilities.

Think of it like managing an international restaurant chain. Just as the chain needs to maintain consistent quality and service across multiple locations while handling local requirements, your Flask application needs to serve models consistently across different environments while handling various deployment challenges.

# Versions

## Version 1: Enterprise Scaling Scenario
You're deploying a mission-critical model that needs 99.99% uptime. Design a Flask application with advanced scaling, load balancing, and failover capabilities.

## Version 2: Multi-Region Deployment Scenario
You're serving models across different geographical regions with specific compliance requirements. Create a Flask application that handles regional routing, data residency, and compliance monitoring.

## Version 3: Microservices Integration Scenario
You're integrating ML models into a microservices architecture. Implement a Flask application that handles service discovery, circuit breaking, and inter-service communication.

## Version 4: Edge Deployment Scenario
You're deploying models to edge devices with intermittent connectivity. Design a Flask application that handles offline operation, synchronization, and edge-specific optimizations.

# Constraints

- Support container orchestration
- Handle service discovery
- Enable circuit breaking
- Implement blue-green deployment
