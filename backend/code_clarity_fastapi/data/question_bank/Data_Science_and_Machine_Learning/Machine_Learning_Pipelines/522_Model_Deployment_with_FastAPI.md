# Problem Description

Deploying machine learning models effectively is critical to making their predictions available in real-time applications. FastAPI is a high-performance web framework for Python, allowing developers to create robust APIs for model serving. In this problem set, you will explore how to deploy models with FastAPI while addressing potential challenges in handling data validation, security, scalability, and monitoring.

# Versions

### Version 1: Basic Model Deployment

**Scenario**: You work for a company that builds a recommendation system for an e-commerce platform. Your team has developed a machine learning model that predicts user preferences based on their browsing history and past purchases. Your task is to deploy this model so it can be accessed by other parts of the application.

- You need to create a simple FastAPI app that loads the pre-trained model and provides an endpoint for making predictions.
- Ensure that the endpoint is user-friendly, and the response is formatted for easy integration with the platform's frontend.

**Questions**:

1. What are the key steps for setting up and running a FastAPI app for model deployment?
2. What potential issues could arise when handling different types of input data?

**Coding Task**:

- Write a basic FastAPI app that loads a pre-trained model (e.g., a scikit-learn or TensorFlow model) and creates an endpoint for making predictions. Ensure the app returns predictions in a structured JSON format.

### Version 2: Advanced Input Validation and Error Handling

**Scenario**: The deployed model is now live and receiving input from different user devices and applications. However, input data can sometimes be incomplete, incorrect, or in unexpected formats. To ensure smooth operation, the API must validate incoming requests and provide clear error messages for invalid data.

- Integrate pydantic to create data models for input validation.
- Implement error handling that captures and logs issues when data does not match expected formats or is missing required fields.

**Questions**:

1. Why is input validation important, and how does it help prevent issues in production?
2. How can you create comprehensive error responses that help users correct their input?

**Coding Task**:

- Extend your FastAPI app to validate input data using pydantic models. Implement error-handling mechanisms that return clear, helpful error messages when input data fails validation checks.

### Version 3: Deploying Batch Processing Capabilities

**Scenario**: The e-commerce platform decides to run marketing campaigns based on user predictions and needs the ability to make batch predictions. This means processing hundreds or thousands of user data points in a single request.

- Modify the API to handle and process batch requests efficiently.
- Implement data processing techniques to reduce memory usage and improve performance.

**Questions**:

1. What techniques can be used to handle batch processing without running out of memory or significantly slowing down the API?
2. How do you optimize data processing for fast response times when handling large batches of input?

**Coding Task**:

- Update your FastAPI app to accept batch requests and return a JSON array of predictions. Implement techniques to manage memory effectively and ensure the API remains responsive.

### Version 4: Adding Security Features

**Scenario**: Your deployed API is starting to attract more traffic as its use expands to partner websites and applications. However, this increased exposure makes it more susceptible to unauthorized access and data breaches.

- Implement authentication (e.g., API keys or OAuth 2.0) to secure your endpoints.
- Ensure that data transmitted to and from the API is encrypted using HTTPS.

**Questions**:

1. What are the best practices for securing API endpoints and handling user authentication?
2. How do you ensure that sensitive user data is protected during transmission?

**Coding Task**:

- Integrate an authentication system in your FastAPI app that requires users to include a valid API key in their requests. Configure the app to use HTTPS for secure communication.

### Version 5: Real-Time Monitoring and Logging

**Scenario**: The API is now essential for the platform's operations, making it important to track its performance and catch any issues early.

- Integrate tools for monitoring the health and performance of the API.
- Set up logging to capture detailed information about incoming requests, responses, and errors.

**Questions**:

1. Which tools or libraries are most effective for monitoring FastAPI applications in real-time?
2. How can you balance detailed logging with maintaining performance and not overloading storage?

**Coding Task**:

- Add logging and monitoring to your FastAPI app using libraries like uvicorn's built-in logging and external tools such as Prometheus and Grafana for real-time performance tracking.

### Version 6: Scalability and Load Testing

**Scenario**: The API is handling thousands of requests per day, and traffic is expected to grow further, especially during promotions or holiday sales.

- Implement strategies to scale the FastAPI app horizontally using containerization and orchestration tools like Docker and Kubernetes.
- Conduct load testing to understand how the API performs under different levels of traffic.

**Questions**:

1. What methods can you use to scale a FastAPI deployment for high traffic scenarios?
2. How do you perform load testing to find potential bottlenecks and plan capacity?

**Coding Task**:

- Containerize your FastAPI app using Docker and set up Kubernetes configurations for deploying and scaling the app. Write a script or use a tool like Locust to simulate load testing and analyze the API's performance.

## Constraints

- Ensure the deployed model can handle different input data structures (e.g., JSON, CSV).
- The app should remain performant even under significant load or when handling batch requests.
- Implement security best practices, including data encryption and user authentication.

## Notes

- Focus on creating modular code for easier maintenance and updates.
- Include comprehensive documentation and comments in your code.
- Think about how user experience is impacted by response times and error clarity.
