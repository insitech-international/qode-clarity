# Problem Description

Imagine you're a research scientist developing cutting-edge training methodologies for next-generation AI models. Your challenge is to design advanced training techniques that improve model performance, stability, and efficiency beyond traditional approaches.

Think of it like developing a training program for Olympic athletes. Just as elite athletes require sophisticated training regimens that push the boundaries of human performance, advanced AI models need specialized training techniques to achieve state-of-the-art results.

# Versions

## Version 1: Meta-Learning Scenario
You're developing a system that learns how to learn, adapting its learning strategy based on the task at hand. Implement a meta-learning framework that improves learning efficiency across different domains.

## Version 2: Adversarial Training Scenario
You're building robust models that resist adversarial attacks. Design an advanced training pipeline that incorporates adversarial examples and defensive distillation.

## Version 3: Federated Learning Scenario
You
