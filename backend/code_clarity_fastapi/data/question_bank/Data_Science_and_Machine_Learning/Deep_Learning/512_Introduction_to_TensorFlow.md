# Problem Description

Imagine you're learning to be an AI wizard! Just like how you might use LEGO blocks to build amazing structures, TensorFlow is like a magical set of blocks that helps us create artificial intelligence. It's like teaching a computer to think and learn, just like how you learn new things every day!

Think of tensors like magical containers that hold numbers. Just like how you organize your toys in different boxes and shelves, we need to organize our numbers in special ways for the computer to understand them.

Imagine you're organizing a huge library of storybooks:

- First, you need to put each word into special boxes (tensors)
- Then, you need to arrange these boxes in a way that makes sense
- Finally, you need to make sure all the boxes are the same size, just like making sure all your LEGO buildings fit on the same baseplate

## Version 1: Tensor Manipulation

### Context

You're tasked with preprocessing text data for a natural language processing (NLP) model.

### Key Tasks

1. **Creating and Managing Tensors**:

   ```python
   # Basic tensor creation
   text_tensor = tf.constant(['Hello', 'World'])
   embeddings = tf.random.uniform([vocab_size, embedding_dim])

   # Shape manipulation
   reshaped = tf.reshape(text_tensor, [batch_size, sequence_length])
   ```

2. **Text Preprocessing Pipeline**:

   - Tokenization using `tf.keras.preprocessing.text.Tokenizer`
   - Padding sequences with `tf.keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences`
   - Creating embedding layers with `tf.keras.layers.Embedding`

3. **Handling Variable Sequences**:
   - Implementing masking for variable lengths
   - Using ragged tensors for efficiency
   - Managing batch processing with dynamic shapes

### Expected Outputs

- Properly formatted tensor batches
- Efficient preprocessing pipeline
- Memory-optimized data structures

## Version 2: Model Construction

### Context

Design a sequence-to-sequence model for language translation.

### Key Components

1. **Encoder-Decoder Architecture**:

   ```python
   class Translator(tf.keras.Model):
       def __init__(self):
           super().__init__()
           self.encoder = Encoder(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
           self.decoder = Decoder(vocab_size, embedding_dim)

       def call(self, inputs):
           context = self.encoder(inputs)
           output = self.decoder(context)
           return output
   ```

2. **Custom Training Loop**:

   - Implementing gradient tape
   - Managing teacher forcing
   - Handling attention mechanisms

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Custom metrics implementation
   - BLEU score calculation
   - Loss monitoring and validation

---

## Version 3: Model Optimization

### Context

Optimize a TensorFlow model for production deployment.

### Key Steps

1. **Model Pruning**:

   ```python
   pruning_schedule = tf.keras.optimizers.schedules.PolynomialDecay(
       initial_sparsity=0.0,
       final_sparsity=0.5,
       begin_step=0,
       end_step=end_step
   )
   ```

2. **Quantization**:

   - Post-training quantization
   - Quantization-aware training
   - Mixed precision training

3. **Mobile Optimization**:
   - TensorFlow Lite conversion
   - Performance benchmarking
   - Memory footprint reduction
