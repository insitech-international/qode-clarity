# Problem Description

Imagine you're developing an AI system for a medical imaging company. The system needs to learn from thousands of medical scans to identify potential health issues. However, the training process is complex, involving multiple stages, different types of data, and various learning objectives.

Think of it like teaching a medical resident. Just as a resident learns through structured programs, hands-on experience, and feedback from senior doctors, your model needs a well-designed training regime with proper supervision, feedback mechanisms, and evaluation criteria.

# Versions

## Version 1: Supervised Learning Scenario
You're training a model to diagnose skin conditions from photographs. You have a dataset of 100,000 labeled images, but the labels are noisy and the conditions are imbalanced. Design a robust training pipeline that handles these challenges.

## Version 2: Transfer Learning Scenario
You're building a sentiment analysis model for a new language with limited labeled data. Use transfer learning from existing language models to create an effective solution with minimal labeled data.

## Version 3: Multi-Task Learning Scenario
You're developing an autonomous driving system that must simultaneously detect objects, predict their movements, and plan vehicle actions. Design a training strategy for this multi-objective learning task.

## Version 4: Continuous Learning Scenario
You're creating a recommendation system that needs to continuously learn from user interactions. Design a training pipeline that can adapt to new data while avoiding catastrophic forgetting.
