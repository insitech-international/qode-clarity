# Problem Description

You are tasked with designing robust exception handling mechanisms using context managers. The challenge is to create a system that ensures proper resource management, clean-up operations, and error handling across various scenarios, while maintaining code readability and reusability.

## Version 3: Real-life Scenarios

1. **Database Transaction Management**:
   Design a context manager for handling database transactions that ensures proper commit or rollback operations, even in the face of exceptions.
   
   Questions:
   - How would you handle nested transactions within the same context manager?
   - What approach would you take to implement savepoints and partial rollbacks?
   - How would you design the context manager to work with different database backends that might have varying transaction APIs?
   - What strategies would you employ to handle long-running transactions that might exceed network timeouts?

2. **Distributed Lock Management**:
   Create a context manager for acquiring and releasing distributed locks in a microservices architecture.
   
   Questions:
   - How would you handle scenarios where the lock acquisition process itself might fail or timeout?
   - What approach would you take to implement lock renewal for long-running operations?
   - How would you design the system to detect and resolve deadlock situations?
   - What strategies would you use to ensure that locks are always released, even if the process crashes unexpectedly?

3. **Resource Pool Management**:
   Develop a context manager for managing a pool of reusable resources (e.g., network connections, worker threads).
   
   Questions:
   - How would you handle scenarios where all resources in the pool are exhausted?
   - What approach would you take to implement resource health checks and automatic recovery of faulty resources?
   - How would you design the system to dynamically scale the resource pool based on usage patterns?
   - What strategies would you employ to ensure fair resource allocation among multiple consumers?

4. **File System Operations with Rollback**:
   Implement a context manager for file system operations that allows for atomic operations with rollback capability.
   
   Questions:
   - How would you handle scenarios involving operations across multiple files or directories?
   - What approach would you take to implement versioning or backup mechanisms within the context manager?
   - How would you design the system to work efficiently with both small and large files?
   - What strategies would you use to handle permissions issues or disk space constraints?

5. **Temporary Environment Modifications**:
   Create a context manager for temporarily modifying environment variables or system settings for the duration of a specific operation.
   
   Questions:
   - How would you handle scenarios where the modifications might affect concurrent operations in a multi-threaded environment?
   - What approach would you take to ensure that the original environment is always restored, even in case of unexpected termination?
   - How would you design the system to allow for nested or overlapping environment modifications?
   - What strategies would you employ to track and log environment changes for debugging purposes?

6. **Error Aggregation and Reporting**:
   Develop a context manager that aggregates and summarizes multiple exceptions that might occur during a complex operation.
   
   Questions:
   - How would you handle scenarios where you want to continue execution after certain types of exceptions?
   - What approach would you take to categorize and prioritize different types of exceptions?
   - How would you design the system to provide meaningful error reports that can aid in debugging?
   - What strategies would you use to integrate this with existing logging or monitoring systems?

7. **Transactional Memory Operations**:
   Implement a context manager for transactional memory operations in a concurrent programming environment.
   
   Questions:
   - How would you handle conflicts between multiple transactions attempting to modify the same memory locations?
   - What approach would you take to implement different isolation levels (e.g., read committed, serializable)?
   - How would you design the system to optimize performance for read-heavy vs. write-heavy workloads?
   - What strategies would you employ to detect and prevent livelocks or deadlocks in the transactional system?

8. **API Rate Limiting and Backoff**:
   Create a context manager for handling API requests with built-in rate limiting, backoff, and retry logic.
   
   Questions:
   - How would you handle different rate limits for various API endpoints or user tiers?
   - What approach would you take to implement adaptive backoff strategies based on server response times?
   - How would you design the system to efficiently use rate limit quotas across multiple parallel operations?
   - What strategies would you use to gracefully degrade functionality when rate limits are consistently exceeded?

**Advanced Considerations**
1. **Asynchronous Context Managers**:
   Extend the concept of context managers to work with asynchronous code and coroutines.
   
   Questions:
   - How would you design asynchronous context managers to work seamlessly with both synchronous and asynchronous code?
   - What approaches could be used to handle timeouts in asynchronous context managers?
   - How might you implement cancellation of asynchronous operations within a context manager?

2. **Distributed Context Managers**:
   Consider how context managers could be extended to work across distributed systems.
   
   Questions:
   - How would you implement a context manager that spans multiple nodes in a distributed system?
   - What strategies could be used to handle partial failures in a distributed context?
   - How might you design a system for coordinating distributed transactions using context managers?

3. **Machine Learning Experiment Management**:
   Design context managers for managing machine learning experiments, including resource allocation, result tracking, and reproducibility.
   
   Questions:
   - How would you implement a context manager that captures all relevant parameters and outputs of an ML experiment?
   - What approaches could be used to integrate experiment tracking with version control systems?
   - How might you design context managers to manage distributed training across multiple GPUs or machines?

4. **Security and Auditing**:
   Develop context managers that enhance security and provide auditing capabilities.
   
   Questions:
   - How would you implement a context manager that provides temporary elevated permissions while ensuring they are always revoked?
   - What strategies could be used to create an audit trail of all actions performed within a specific context?
   - How might you design context managers to integrate with external security information and event management (SIEM) systems?

These scenarios and questions aim to explore context managers for exception handling in the context of complex, real-world systems. They encourage thinking about robustness, efficiency, and advanced software design principles when applying context managers to solve sophisticated problems in various domains.
