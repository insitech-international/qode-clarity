# Problem Description

You are tasked with designing a robust error handling system using custom exceptions. The challenge is to create a hierarchy of exception classes that accurately represent different error conditions, provide meaningful information for debugging and error recovery, and integrate well with existing exception handling mechanisms.

## Version 3: Real-life Scenarios

1. **Financial Transaction System**:
   Design a custom exception hierarchy for a financial transaction system that handles various error conditions such as insufficient funds, exceeded transfer limits, and regulatory compliance issues.

   Questions:

   - How would you structure the exception hierarchy to differentiate between user errors, system errors, and third-party service failures?
   - What approach would you take to include relevant transaction details in the exception without exposing sensitive information?
   - How would you design exceptions to facilitate automatic retry logic for certain types of failures?
   - What strategies would you employ to ensure that exception handling doesn't significantly impact transaction processing speed?

2. **Healthcare Data Processing Pipeline**:
   Create custom exceptions for a healthcare data processing system that deals with patient records, medical test results, and treatment plans.

   Questions:

   - How would you design exceptions to handle data inconsistencies while maintaining patient privacy?
   - What approach would you take to create exceptions that can guide the system in partial data processing scenarios?
   - How would you structure exceptions to clearly differentiate between critical errors requiring immediate attention and non-critical issues?
   - What strategies would you use to ensure that exception messages are informative for developers but don't expose protected health information?

3. **E-commerce Order Fulfillment System**:
   Develop a custom exception system for an e-commerce platform's order fulfillment process, handling issues like inventory discrepancies, shipping errors, and payment processing failures.

   Questions:

   - How would you design exceptions to facilitate graceful degradation of the ordering process when certain services are unavailable?
   - What approach would you take to create exceptions that can trigger automatic compensating actions (e.g., reserving inventory from a different warehouse)?
   - How would you structure the exception hierarchy to allow for easy addition of new error types as the platform expands to new markets or adds new features?
   - What strategies would you employ to use exceptions in generating customer-friendly error messages in multiple languages?

4. **Distributed Cache System**:
   Implement custom exceptions for a distributed caching system that handles data replication, consistency, and partition tolerance.

   Questions:

   - How would you design exceptions to represent different levels of cache inconsistency or unavailability?
   - What approach would you take to create exceptions that can guide the system in choosing between consistency and availability in specific scenarios?
   - How would you structure exceptions to provide meaningful debugging information in a distributed environment?
   - What strategies would you use to ensure that exception handling doesn't introduce significant latency in cache operations?

5. **Machine Learning Model Deployment Pipeline**:
   Create a custom exception hierarchy for a system that handles the deployment, monitoring, and updating of machine learning models in production.

   Questions:

   - How would you design exceptions to handle issues like model drift, input data anomalies, or unexpected output distributions?
   - What approach would you take to create exceptions that can trigger automatic model rollbacks or fallback to previous versions?
   - How would you structure exceptions to differentiate between issues in different stages of the ML pipeline (data preprocessing, inference, postprocessing)?
   - What strategies would you employ to ensure that exceptions provide enough context for both data scientists
