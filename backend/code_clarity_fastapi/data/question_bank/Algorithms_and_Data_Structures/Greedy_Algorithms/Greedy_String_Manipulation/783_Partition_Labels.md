# Problem Description

Imagine you have a bunch of items of different weights or values, and you want to divide them evenly among several groups. The challenge is to split these items in such a way that each group ends up with roughly the same total weight or value.

Think of it like trying to pack boxes of different sizes so that each box weighs about the same, or dividing chores fairly among family members so everyone has an equal workload.

The goal is to find the most balanced way to split things up, even though some items might be much heavier or more time-consuming than others. It's like solving a puzzle where you need to fit together pieces of different sizes to create groups that are as close to equal as possible.

In real life, this problem comes up in many situations - from organizing work teams, planning deliveries, or even dividing inheritance among heirs. The partition problem helps us figure out how to do this division in the fairest and most efficient way possible.

# Version 1: LeetCode - 763. Partition Label

You are given a string s. We want to partition the string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part.

Note that the partition is done so that after concatenating all the parts in order, the resultant string should be s.

Return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.

Example 1:

Input: s = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
Output: [9,7,8]
Explanation:
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits s into less parts.
Example 2:

Input: s = "eccbbbbdec"
Output: [10]

**Scenario 1: Project Management**
You are a project manager working on a content distribution strategy. Each task in your project is represented as a string where each character represents a unique task. The goal is to partition the tasks into the smallest number of sections such that each task is completed without interruption. A task can be interrupted if it appears in multiple sections.

**Scenario 2: Manufacturing Process Optimization**
In a manufacturing plant, you need to optimize the production line. Each product requires a series of operations, represented by characters in a string. To minimize setup times, you want to group operations so that each type of operation is performed continuously without interruption. Determine the optimal grouping of operations.

**Scenario 3: Software Development Sprint Planning**
You're planning sprints for a software development team. Each feature is represented by a character, and the string represents the sequence of features to be developed. To optimize the development process, you want to group features that have dependencies or shared resources. Create an algorithm to determine the optimal sprint divisions.

For all scenarios, create an algorithm that determines how many sections can be formed by partitioning the tasks, ensuring that each task appears in only one section at a time.

Example 1:
Input: "abac"
Output: 2
Explanation: The string can be partitioned into 'aba' and 'c', allowing all tasks to be completed in two sections.

Example 2:
Input: "eccbade"
Output: 3
Explanation: The string can be partitioned into 'ecc', 'b', and 'ade', ensuring all tasks are completed without overlap.

# Constraints

```
1 <= s.length <= 500
s consists of lowercase English letters.
```

# Notes

The "Partition Labels" problem exemplifies greedy string manipulation techniques. It requires analyzing the string character by character, keeping track of the last occurrence of each character, and making decisions about partitioning based on this information. The goal is to maximize the number of partitions while ensuring each letter appears in at most one part.

Key concepts involved:

Character frequency tracking
Last occurrence index management
Dynamic partitioning
Greedy decision-making
This problem demonstrates how greedy algorithms can be applied to string manipulation problems, often leading to efficient solutions with good time complexity.
