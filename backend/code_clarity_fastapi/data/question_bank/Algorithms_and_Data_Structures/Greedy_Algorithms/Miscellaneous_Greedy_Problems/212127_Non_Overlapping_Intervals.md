# Problem Description

Imagine you're responsible for scheduling meetings in a limited number of conference rooms. Each meeting has a specific start and end time. Your task is to maximize the use of available rooms by determining the maximum number of meetings that can be scheduled without overlapping. You need to avoid scheduling conflicts and ensure efficient use of resources.

This problem is all about optimizing resource allocation in scenarios where you have time-based constraints. It's similar to managing event calendars, allocating shared equipment, or coordinating shifts where you need to make the most of limited resources while avoiding conflicts.

### Versions

## Version 1: Conference Room Scheduling

You are tasked with scheduling meetings in a limited number of conference rooms. Each meeting has a specific start and end time. To maximize the use of available rooms, you need to determine the maximum number of meetings that can be scheduled without overlapping. Your goal is to avoid scheduling conflicts and ensure efficient use of resources.

Create an algorithm that finds the maximum number of non-overlapping meetings that can be scheduled given their start and end times.

Example 1:
Input: [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,3]]
Output: 3
Explanation: Three meetings can be scheduled: [1,2], [2,3], and [3,4]. The meeting [1,3] overlaps with both [1,2] and [2,3], so it cannot be included.

Example 2:
Input: [[1,2], [1,2], [1,2]]
Output: 1
Explanation: All meetings overlap with each other, so only one meeting can be scheduled.

Example 3:
Input: [[1,2], [3,4], [5,6], [7,8], [5,9]]
Output: 5
Explanation: Five meetings can be scheduled: [1,2], [3,4], [5,6], [7,8], and [5,9] because [5,9] overlaps with [5,6].

## Version 2: Real-Life Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Event Planning

You're organizing a large conference with multiple parallel sessions. Each session has a start and end time. To maximize the use of available rooms, you need to determine the maximum number of sessions that can run simultaneously without conflicts.

### Scenario 2: Resource Allocation

In a manufacturing plant, you have limited machines that can work on different projects. Each project has a start and end time. Your goal is to schedule these projects efficiently to maximize machine utilization while avoiding overlaps.

### Scenario 3: Shift Management

You're managing shifts for employees at a retail store. Each shift has a start and end time. To ensure proper coverage and avoid overstaffing, you want to find the maximum number of non-overlapping shifts that can be scheduled.

For all scenarios, create an algorithm that finds the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals given their start and end times.

# Constraints

- Each meeting is represented by a start and end time, with the start being less than the end.
- The input array can contain up to 10^4 meetings.

# Notes

This problem demonstrates the application of greedy algorithms to interval scheduling problems. The key insight is to sort the intervals based on their end times and then iteratively select the earliest ending interval that doesn't conflict with previously selected ones.

Key concepts involved:

- Interval sorting
- Greedy selection
- Non-overlapping intervals
- Resource allocation

The optimal solution typically involves sorting the intervals based on their end times and then iterating through them, selecting the ones that allow for the maximum coverage with the fewest number of selections. This approach ensures a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the number of intervals.

Understanding this problem helps in developing efficient algorithms for event planning, resource allocation, and logistical management where you need to optimize the use of limited resources while avoiding conflicts.```
