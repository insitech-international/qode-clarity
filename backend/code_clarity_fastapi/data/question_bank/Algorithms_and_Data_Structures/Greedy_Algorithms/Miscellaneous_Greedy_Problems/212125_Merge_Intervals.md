# Problem Description

Imagine you're managing a busy calendar with multiple appointments and events. Some of these events may overlap in time. Your task is to consolidate these overlapping events into single, continuous blocks of time. This helps in creating a cleaner, more organized schedule and prevents double-booking of time slots.

This problem is about efficiently combining overlapping time ranges into non-overlapping segments. It's similar to optimizing schedules, managing resource allocations, or streamlining workflows where you need to eliminate redundancies and create a more streamlined plan.

### Versions

## Version 1: Calendar Optimization

Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

Example 1:
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]

Example 2:
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]

## Version 2: Real-Life Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Resource Allocation

You're managing a manufacturing plant with multiple machines. Each machine has scheduled maintenance periods represented by intervals. To optimize production, you need to merge overlapping maintenance periods to minimize downtime and ensure efficient resource allocation.

### Scenario 2: Event Planning

You're organizing a conference with multiple parallel sessions. Each session has a start and end time represented by intervals. To create a clear schedule, you want to merge any overlapping sessions into single blocks of time.

### Scenario 3: Time Blocking

As a productivity coach, you're helping clients optimize their daily schedules. You need to take their various time commitments (represented as intervals) and merge any overlapping ones to create a streamlined day plan.

For all scenarios, create an algorithm that merges all overlapping intervals into non-overlapping segments.

Example 1:
Input: [[1,3], [2,6], [8,10], [15,18]]
Output: [[1,6], [8,10], [15,18]]

Example 2:
Input: [[1,4], [4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]

# Constraints

- The input array contains intervals where each interval is an array of two integers, start and end.
- The input array can contain up to 10^4 intervals.
- The start time of each interval is guaranteed to be less than or equal to the end time.

# Notes

This problem demonstrates the application of sorting and merging techniques to interval-related problems. The key steps involve:

1. Sorting the intervals based on their start times.
2. Iterating through the sorted intervals and merging overlapping ones.
3. Creating a new merged interval when necessary.

Key concepts involved:
- Interval sorting
- Merging logic
- Time complexity optimization

The optimal solution typically involves sorting the intervals (O(n log n)) and then iterating through them once (O(n)), resulting in an overall time complexity of O(n log n).

Understanding this problem helps in developing efficient algorithms for calendar management, resource allocation, and time optimization in various domains where dealing with overlapping time ranges is common.```
