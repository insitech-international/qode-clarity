# Problem Description

You are tasked with optimizing resource allocation in various scenarios related to vehicle refueling, charging, or service scheduling. The goal is to maximize efficiency and complete as many tasks as possible within given constraints.

# Versions

## Version 1: LeetCode - Circular Route Gas Stations

There are n gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the ith station is gas[i]. You have a car with an unlimited gas tank, and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from the ith station to its next (i + 1)th station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Given two integer arrays gas and cost, return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1. If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.

Example:

- Input: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
- Output: 3
- Explanation:
  - Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
  - Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
  - Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
  - Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
  - Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
  - Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
  - Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.

## Version 2: HackerRank - Race Fuel Management

Jenny is competing in a race with her car containing X litres of fuel. There are N milestones in the competition. It takes no fuel to travel between gas stations, but at the ith fuel station, Pi amount of petrol is drained.

Find the number of milestones Jenny crosses before her car runs out of fuel.

Input Format:

- First line: N and X (space-separated)
- Second line: N space-separated integers representing Pi

Example:

- Input:
  14 13
  8 2 13 12 3 6 12 13 5 6 12 2 2 1
- Output: 3

## Version 3: Real-Life Resource Allocation Scenarios

1. **Advanced Gas Station Management**:
   You manage a busy gas station with multiple pumps. Vehicles of various types (cars, trucks, motorcycles) arrive at different times, each with specific fuel requirements and time constraints.

   - Each vehicle has an arrival time, fuel requirement, and a maximum waiting time.
   - Different vehicle types have different fueling speeds.
   - Some vehicles may have priority (e.g., emergency vehicles).
   - The station has a limited number of pumps, each with its own efficiency rating.
   - Fuel prices fluctuate throughout the day, affecting customer behavior.

   Goal: Develop an algorithm to optimize the refueling schedule, maximizing both the number of vehicles served and the station's profit.

2. **Smart Electric Vehicle Charging Station**:
   You're designing a system for a large electric vehicle (EV) charging station in a busy urban area.

   - EVs arrive with different battery levels, capacities, and charging speed capabilities.
   - The station has multiple chargers with varying power outputs (Level 1, 2, and 3 chargers).
   - Energy costs vary based on time of day due to grid demand.
   - Some vehicles may opt for partial charging based on their immediate needs.
   - The system must balance grid load to prevent overloading.
   - Charging slots can be pre-booked, creating a mix of scheduled and impromptu charging needs.

   Goal: Create an algorithm that optimizes the charging schedule to maximize the number of vehicles charged, minimize waiting times, and manage energy consumption efficiently.

3. **Dynamic Food Delivery Optimization**:
   You're building a system for a food delivery service operating in a large metropolitan area.

   - Orders come in real-time with specified pickup locations (restaurants) and delivery addresses.
   - Each order has a preparation time, pickup window, and delivery deadline.
   - Multiple delivery personnel are available, each with different vehicle types (bicycles, motorcycles, cars) affecting travel speeds.
   - Traffic conditions change throughout the day, impacting travel times.
   - Some orders may be bundled for efficient multi-drop deliveries.
   - Restaurants have varying preparation times and capacity constraints.
   - Customers may have priority levels based on subscription status.

   Goal: Develop an algorithm that dynamically assigns and routes delivery personnel to maximize the number of on-time deliveries, minimize travel distances, and optimize customer satisfaction.

For all scenarios, your solution should:

- Handle real-time updates and dynamic rescheduling.
- Consider multiple constraints simultaneously.
- Be scalable to handle increasing complexity and volume.
- Provide options for different optimization priorities (e.g., maximizing throughput vs. maximizing profit).

Example (for Gas Station Scenario):

```python
Input:
vehicles = [
    {"id": "Car1", "type": "car", "arrival": 10, "fuel_needed": 30, "max_wait": 15},
    {"id": "Truck1", "type": "truck", "arrival": 12, "fuel_needed": 100, "max_wait": 30},
    {"id": "Car2", "type": "car", "arrival": 13, "fuel_needed": 20, "max_wait": 10},
    {"id": "Emergency1", "type": "emergency", "arrival": 14, "fuel_needed": 40, "max_wait": 5}
]
pumps = [
    {"id": 1, "efficiency": 1.2},
    {"id": 2, "efficiency": 1.0},
    {"id": 3, "efficiency": 0.8}
]

Output:
[
    {"vehicle": "Car1", "pump": 1, "start_time": 10, "end_time": 22},
    {"vehicle": "Emergency1", "pump": 2, "start_time": 14, "end_time": 24},
    {"vehicle": "Car2", "pump": 3, "start_time": 13, "end_time": 28},
    {"vehicle": "Truck1", "pump": 1, "start_time": 22, "end_time": 52}
]
```

# Constraints

- Tasks can only be executed once.
- Tasks must be completed within specified time windows or constraints.
- Specific constraints vary based on the scenario (e.g., circular route, limited resources, dynamic conditions).
- Solutions should handle edge cases and unexpected scenarios gracefully.

# Notes

- Solutions should be adaptable to various scenarios while maintaining core optimization logic.
- Consider using greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, or advanced scheduling algorithms for efficient solutions.
- Real-world implementations may require integration with external systems (e.g., payment systems, traffic APIs, energy management systems).
- Consider implementing simulation capabilities to test and refine algorithms under various conditions.
