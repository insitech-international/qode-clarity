## Problem Description

You are given a set of tasks, each with a start time, duration, and potentially other attributes such as deadlines or priorities. The goal is to schedule these tasks efficiently, typically maximizing the number of completed tasks or minimizing the total completion time.

## Versions

### Version 1: LeetCode - Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended

Given an array of events where events[i] = [startDayi, endDayi]. Every event i starts at startDayi and ends at endDayi.

You can attend an event i at any day d where startTimei <= d <= endTimei. You can only attend one event at any time d.

Return the maximum number of events you can attend.

Example:

- Input: events = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
- Output: 3
- Explanation: You can attend all the events, as they are not conflicting.

### Version 2: HackerRank - Greedy Florist

A group of friends want to buy a bouquet of flowers. The florist wants to maximize his number of new customers and the money he makes. To do this, he decides he'll multiply the price of each flower by the number of that customer's previously purchased flowers plus 1. The first flower will be original price, (0+1)x, the next will be (1+1)x and so on.

Given the size of the group of friends, the number of flowers they want to purchase and the original prices of the flowers, determine the minimum cost to purchase all of the flowers.

Example:

- Input:
  c = [1, 2, 3, 4] (original flower costs)
  k = 3 (number of friends)
- Output: 11
- Explanation: (1x1 + 1x2 + 1x3) + (2x4) = 6 + 5 = 11

### Version 3: Real-Life Task Scheduling Scenarios

1. **Software Development Sprint Planning**:
   You're a project manager planning a two-week sprint. Given a list of tasks with story points (effort estimation) and priorities:
   a) Determine the maximum number of high-priority tasks that can be completed.
   b) Create a schedule that balances task priorities and team workload.
   c) Identify tasks that might be at risk of not being completed within the sprint.

2. **Factory Production Line Scheduling**:
   A factory has multiple production lines, each capable of producing different products. Given a list of orders with deadlines and production times:
   a) Determine the maximum number of orders that can be completed on time.
   b) Create a production schedule that minimizes idle time on the production lines.
   c) Suggest optimal maintenance windows that least affect order completion.

3. **University Course Timetabling**:
   A university needs to schedule courses for the upcoming semester. Given a list of courses, available time slots, and room constraints:
   a) Determine the maximum number of courses that can be scheduled without conflicts.
   b) Create a timetable that maximizes room utilization and minimizes student conflicts.
   c) Identify time slots where additional short courses or seminars could be added.

For all scenarios, develop greedy algorithms that efficiently handle the scheduling challenges while considering real-world constraints and optimization goals.

Example (for Software Development Sprint Planning):

```python
Input:
tasks = [
    {"id": 1, "name": "User Authentication", "story_points": 5, "priority": "High"},
    {"id": 2, "name": "Database Optimization", "story_points": 8, "priority": "Medium"},
    {"id": 3, "name": "UI Redesign", "story_points": 13, "priority": "High"},
    {"id": 4, "name": "API Integration", "story_points": 8, "priority": "High"},
    {"id": 5, "name": "Bug Fixes", "story_points": 3, "priority": "Low"}
]
team_capacity = 30  # story points per sprint

Output:
{
    "scheduled_tasks": [
        {"id": 1, "name": "User Authentication", "story_points": 5},
        {"id": 4, "name": "API Integration", "story_points": 8},
        {"id": 3, "name": "UI Redesign", "story_points": 13},
        {"id": 5, "name": "Bug Fixes", "story_points": 3}
    ],
    "total_story_points": 29,
    "remaining_capacity": 1,
    "unscheduled_tasks": [
        {"id": 2, "name": "Database Optimization", "story_points": 8}
    ]
}
```

## Constraints

- For Version 1:

  - 1 <= events.length <= 10^5
  - events[i].length == 2
  - 1 <= startDayi <= endDayi <= 10^5

- For Version 2:

  - 1 <= n <= 100
  - 1 <= k <= 100
  - 1 <= c[i] <= 10^6

- For Version 3:
  - Constraints may vary based on the specific scenario (e.g., team capacity, production line capabilities).

## Notes

- The core principle of greedy algorithms in task scheduling is to make the locally optimal choice at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum.
- For the LeetCode version, consider sorting events by end time and using a min-heap to track available events.
- The HackerRank version requires a different greedy approach, focusing on minimizing cost rather than maximizing task completion.
- In real-world scenarios, consider additional factors like task dependencies, resource constraints, and dynamic priority changes.
- While greedy algorithms often provide good solutions for scheduling problems, they may not always yield the optimal solution for all scenarios. In some cases, you might need to combine greedy approaches with other techniques like dynamic programming.
- For complex scenarios, consider using heuristics or approximation algorithms to handle NP-hard scheduling problems efficiently.
