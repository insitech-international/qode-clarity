# Problem Description

Imagine you're tasked with watering a long garden using a series of taps placed along its length. Each tap has a certain range within which it can water the ground. Your goal is to determine the minimum number of taps needed to cover the entire garden, considering the ranges of each tap.

This problem is about optimizing resource allocation in scenarios where you have overlapping coverage areas. It's similar to planning infrastructure projects, allocating resources across a region, or designing urban development strategies where you need to maximize coverage with minimal investments.

### Versions

## Version 1: Garden Watering Optimization

Given a garden represented as a single-dimensional axis of length L, and a set of taps positioned at various points along this axis, find the minimum number of taps needed to water the entire garden. Return -1 if it's impossible to water the whole garden.

Example 1:
Input: L = 5, taps = [[1,3]], newTap = [2,5]
Output: 1
Explanation: We can open the tap at position 3 to water the entire garden.

Example 2:
Input: L = 5, taps = [ [0,30],[5,10],[15,20] ], newTap = [2,7]
Output: 2
Explanation: Two taps are needed: one at position 0 to cover [0,30], and another at position 5 to cover [5,10].

## Version 2: Real-Life Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Urban Planning

You're tasked with installing streetlights along a highway. Each light has a certain illumination radius. Determine how many lights are needed to illuminate the entire highway, given their positions and radii.

### Scenario 2: Network Coverage

A telecommunications company wants to install cell towers along a coastline. Each tower has a coverage area. Find the minimum number of towers needed to cover the entire coastline.

### Scenario 3: Resource Allocation

In a mining operation, you have drilling equipment placed at various locations. Each drill has a maximum reach. Calculate the minimum number of drills needed to extract resources from every part of the mine.

For all scenarios, create an algorithm that determines the minimum number of units (lights, towers, drills) needed to cover a given area completely.

# Constraints

- The garden is represented as a single-dimensional axis of length L.
- Each tap is represented as a pair [start, end], where start and end are integers.
- The input array can contain up to 10^4 taps.
- The start time of each tap is guaranteed to be less than or equal to the end time.

# Notes

This problem demonstrates the application of greedy algorithms to optimize resource allocation problems. The key steps involve:

1. Creating a coverage array to track the maximum reachable distance from each position.
2. Iterating through the taps and updating the coverage array.
3. Finding the minimum number of taps needed to cover the entire garden using a greedy approach.

Key concepts involved:
- Greedy algorithm
- Interval processing
- Dynamic programming (can be used as an alternative approach)

The optimal solution typically involves creating a coverage array (O(L)) and then iterating through the taps once (O(T)), resulting in an overall time complexity of O(L + T), where L is the length of the garden and T is the number of taps.

Understanding this problem helps in developing efficient algorithms for resource allocation, infrastructure planning, and optimization in scenarios where you need to maximize coverage with minimal resources. While dynamic programming can also solve this problem, the greedy approach is particularly elegant and efficient for this scenario.```
