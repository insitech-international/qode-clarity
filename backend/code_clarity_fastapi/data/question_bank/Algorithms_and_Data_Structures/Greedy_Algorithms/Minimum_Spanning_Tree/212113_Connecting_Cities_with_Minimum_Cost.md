# Problem Description

Imagine you're tasked with building a network of roads or communication lines to connect a group of cities. Each city needs to be connected to every other city, but the cost of building a road between two cities varies. Your goal is to find the minimum cost way to connect all cities together.

This problem is about optimizing network construction in scenarios where you have multiple potential connections between nodes. It's similar to planning telecommunications networks, designing transportation systems, or setting up logistics routes where you need to minimize costs while ensuring full connectivity.

# Versions

## Version 1: LeetCode - Min Cost to Connect All Points

Given a set of points representing cities and the distances between pairs of points, find the minimum cost way to connect all points together. Return -1 if it's impossible to connect all points.

Example 1:
Input: n = 3, connections = [[1,2,5],[1,3,6],[2,3,1]]
Output: 6
Explanation: Connect points 1 and 2 with a cost of 5, and points 2 and 3 with a cost of 1.

Example 2:
Input: n = 4, connections = [[1,2,3],[3,4,4]]
Output: -1
Explanation: Even if all edges are used, there's no feasible method to connect all points.

## Version 2: GeeksForGeeks - Minimum cost to connect all cities

Given a set of cities and the costs of connecting pairs of cities, find the minimum cost way to connect all cities together. Return -1 if it's impossible to connect all cities.

Example 1:
Input: n = 3, connections = [[1,2,5],[1,3,6],[2,3,1]]
Output: 6
Explanation: Connect cities 1 and 2 with a cost of 5, and cities 2 and 3 with a cost of 1.

Example 2:
Input: n = 4, connections = [[1,2,3],[3,4,4]]
Output: -1
Explanation: Even if all edges are used, there's no feasible method to connect all cities.

## Version 3: Real-Life Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Telecommunications Network**

You're tasked with building a fiber optic network to connect multiple towns. Each town has a specific location and a known cost to build a fiber line between any two towns. Determine the minimum cost way to connect all towns with high-speed internet.

**Scenario 2: Road Construction**

A government agency needs to build roads to connect multiple villages. Each village has a known cost to construct a road between any two villages. Find the minimum cost way to ensure all villages are accessible by road.

**Scenario 3: Data Center Deployment**

A tech company wants to deploy data centers in multiple locations. Each location has a known cost to establish a secure connection between any two data centers. Calculate the minimum cost way to ensure all data centers are interconnected.

For all scenarios, create an algorithm that determines the minimum cost way to connect all nodes together.

# Constraints

- The input consists of n cities and m connections.
- Each connection is represented as a tuple [city1, city2, cost].
- The input array can contain up to 10^4 connections.
- The cost of connecting any two cities should be positive.

# Notes

This problem demonstrates the application of graph theory and minimum spanning tree algorithms. The key steps involve:

1. Representing the cities and connections as a weighted graph.
2. Using a minimum spanning tree algorithm (e.g., Kruskal's or Prim's) to find the minimum cost connections.
3. Checking if all cities are connected after applying the algorithm.

Key concepts involved:

- Greedy algorithm
- Minimum spanning tree
- Union-find data structure

The optimal solution typically involves sorting the connections (O(m log m)) and then using a union-find data structure (O(m α(m))), resulting in an overall time complexity of O(m log m + m α(m)), where m is the number of connections and α(m) is the inverse Ackermann function.

Understanding this problem helps in developing efficient algorithms for network design, logistics optimization, and resource allocation in scenarios where you need to minimize costs while ensuring full connectivity. While the exact implementation may vary depending on the chosen algorithm, the core concept remains the same across different platforms and languages.```
