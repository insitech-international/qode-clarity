# Problem Description

Given a set of points in a two-dimensional plane, find the pair of points with the smallest Euclidean distance between them.

# Versions

## Version 1: SPOJ - CLOPPAIR

Find the closest pair of points in a set of N points in the 2D plane. The distance between two points is the standard Euclidean distance.

Example:
```
Input:
5
0 0
0 1
100 45
2 3
9 9

Output:
0 0 0 1 1.000000
```

## Version 2: LeetCode 973 - K Closest Points to Origin

Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).

Example:
```
Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
Output: [[-2,2]]
Explanation: The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
```

## Version 3: HackerRank - Closest Numbers

Given an array of unsorted integers, find the pair of elements that have the smallest absolute difference between them.

Example:
```
Input: arr = [5, 2, 3, 4, 1]
Output: 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5
Explanation: The minimum absolute difference is 1, which occurs between 1 & 2, 2 & 3, 3 & 4, and 4 & 5.
```

## Version 4: CodeChef - DISTANCE

Given N points on a 2D plane, find the minimum Manhattan distance between any pair of points.

Example:
```
Input:
3
0 0
1 1
1 2

Output:
1
```

# Notes

- The naive approach of comparing all pairs of points has O(n^2) time complexity, which is too slow for large datasets.
- An efficient divide-and-conquer algorithm can solve this problem in O(n log n) time.
- Consider using appropriate data structures (e.g., K-d trees) for efficient spatial queries.
- In real-world applications, consider the precision of floating-point calculations and potential rounding errors.
- For geographic applications, be aware of the differences between Euclidean distance and great-circle distance on a sphere.
- In collision detection, consider using spatial partitioning techniques (e.g., quadtrees) for improved performance.
- For astronomical data, be mindful of the scale of distances and the potential need for high-precision arithmetic.
- When dealing with moving points, consider using predictive algorithms to optimize performance.
