# Problem Description

Given a list of user accounts, where each account is represented by a list of strings (the first element is the user's name, and the rest are email addresses associated with that account), merge accounts that belong to the same person. Two accounts belong to the same person if they have a common email address.

# Versions

## Version 1: Basic Account Merging

Implement a function to merge accounts with the following requirements:
1. Merge accounts that share at least one common email address.
2. The merged account should contain all unique email addresses from the original accounts.
3. The merged account's name should be the name from the first account in the input list.
4. Sort the email addresses in the merged accounts.

Example:
```
Input: [["John", "john@example.com", "john@work.com"],
        ["John", "john@work.com", "john@personal.com"],
        ["Mary", "mary@example.com"]]
Output: [["John", "john@example.com", "john@personal.com", "john@work.com"],
         ["Mary", "mary@example.com"]]
```

## Version 2: Account Merging with Confidence Scores

Extend the account merging algorithm to handle confidence scores:
1. Each email address has an associated confidence score (0.0 to 1.0).
2. Merge accounts only if the shared email has a confidence score above a threshold.
3. In the merged account, keep the highest confidence score for each email.
4. Provide a function to adjust the merging threshold dynamically.

Example:
```
Input: [["John", ("john@example.com", 0.9), ("john@work.com", 0.7)],
        ["John", ("john@work.com", 0.8), ("john@personal.com", 0.6)],
        ["Mary", ("mary@example.com", 0.95)]]
Threshold: 0.75
Output: [["John", ("john@example.com", 0.9), ("john@work.com", 0.8), ("john@personal.com", 0.6)],
         ["Mary", ("mary@example.com", 0.95)]]
```

## Version 3: Incremental Account Merging

Implement an incremental account merging system:
1. Start with an initial set of merged accounts.
2. Process new accounts one by one, merging them into existing accounts if necessary.
3. Support undoing the last N merge operations.
4. Provide a function to split incorrectly merged accounts.

Example:
```
Initial: [["John", "john@example.com", "john@work.com"]]
New account: ["John", "john@personal.com", "john@work.com"]
After merge: [["John", "john@example.com", "john@personal.com", "john@work.com"]]
Undo last merge
Split: ["John", "john@personal.com"]
Final: [["John", "john@example.com", "john@work.com"],
        ["John", "john@personal.com"]]
```

## Version 4: Distributed Account Merging

Design a distributed system for account merging across multiple data centers:
1. Each data center has its own set of accounts.
2. Implement a protocol for sharing and merging account information between data centers.
3. Handle conflicts when different data centers have conflicting information.
4. Provide eventual consistency across all data centers.

Example:
```
Data Center 1: [["John", "john@example.com"]]
Data Center 2: [["John", "john@work.com"]]
Data Center 3: [["John", "john@personal.com", "john@work.com"]]
Final Merged (All Data Centers): [["John", "john@example.com", "john@personal.com", "john@work.com"]]
```

# Real-Life Scenarios

1. **Customer Data Integration (CDI) System**:
   Implement a CDI system for a large e-commerce platform:
   - Merge customer profiles from various touchpoints (web, mobile app, in-store).
   - Handle conflicting information from different sources.
   - Maintain a history of profile merges for auditing purposes.
   - Provide real-time updates to all systems using the integrated customer data.

2. **Social Media Identity Resolution**:
   Create a system to identify and link user profiles across different social media platforms:
   - Use email addresses, phone numbers, and usernames as linking attributes.
   - Assign confidence scores based on the uniqueness and reliability of linking attributes.
   - Handle privacy concerns by allowing users to opt-out of cross-platform linking.
   - Generate insights on user behavior across multiple platforms.

3. **Academic Publication Deduplication**:
   Develop a system for a scientific database to merge duplicate author profiles:
   - Use author names, affiliations, and research areas for matching.
   - Handle name variations, misspellings, and transliterations.
   - Allow manual curation and correction of merged profiles.
   - Provide an API for other systems to query and update author information.

4. **Financial Know Your Customer (KYC) System**:
   Implement a KYC system for a multinational bank:
   - Merge customer identities across different branches and countries.
   - Ensure compliance with varying data protection regulations in different jurisdictions.
   - Provide a risk score based on the completeness and consistency of merged profiles.
   - Support real-time identity verification during customer onboarding.

5. **Healthcare Patient Record Consolidation**:
   Create a system to consolidate patient records across different healthcare providers:
   - Merge records based on patient identifiers (name, DOB, SSN, etc.).
   - Handle sensitive information according to HIPAA and other healthcare regulations.
   - Provide an audit trail of all merge and split operations.
   - Support emergency access to consolidated records while maintaining privacy.

# Constraints

- For all versions:
  - 1 ≤ number of accounts ≤ 1000
  - 1 ≤ number of emails per account ≤ 10
  - 1 ≤ length of account name ≤ 30
  - 1 ≤ length of email address ≤ 50

- For Version 2:
  - Confidence scores are floating-point numbers between 0.0 and 1.0

- For Version 3:
  - Maximum number of undo operations: 100

- For Version 4:
  - Number of data centers: 2 ≤ N ≤ 10
  - Maximum network delay between data centers: 500ms

# Notes

- Consider using a disjoint set union (DSU) data structure for efficient account merging.
- In the distributed version, think about how to handle network partitions and ensure eventual consistency.
- For real-world applications, consider implementing privacy-preserving techniques and compliance with data protection regulations.
- Performance optimization is crucial, especially for the incremental and distributed versions.
