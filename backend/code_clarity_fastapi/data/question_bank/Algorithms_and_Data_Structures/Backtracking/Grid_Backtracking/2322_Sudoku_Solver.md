# Problem Description

Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells. A sudoku solution must satisfy all of the following rules:

1. Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each row.
2. Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each column.
3. Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid.

The '.' character indicates empty cells.

# Versions

## Version 1: Classic 9x9 Sudoku

Solve a standard 9x9 Sudoku puzzle.

Example:

Input: 
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
 ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
 [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
 ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
 ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
 ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
 [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
 [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
 [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]

Output: (Filled Sudoku grid)

## Version 2: Hexadoku (16x16)

Solve a 16x16 Sudoku variant using digits 0-9 and letters A-F.

Example:

Input: (16x16 grid with some cells filled)
Output: (Completed 16x16 grid)

## Version 3: Irregular Sudoku

Solve a Sudoku variant where the 3x3 sub-boxes are replaced with irregular shapes, but still contain 9 cells each.

Example:

Input: (9x9 grid with irregular regions defined)
Output: (Completed irregular Sudoku)

## Version 4: Real-Life Scenarios

### Scenario 1: University Course Scheduling

You're developing a course scheduling system for a university:

a) Create an algorithm to assign courses to time slots and rooms, ensuring no conflicts for students or professors.
b) Extend the algorithm to handle courses with multiple sessions per week and varying durations.
c) Implement a feature to optimize room utilization and minimize travel time between classes for students.

### Scenario 2: Hospital Staff Rotation

You're designing a staff scheduling system for a hospital:

a) Develop an algorithm to create weekly schedules for nurses, ensuring all shifts are covered and labor regulations are met.
b) Modify the algorithm to account for different skill levels and departments.
c) Implement a feature to balance workload and accommodate staff preferences while maintaining fair distribution of night and weekend shifts.

### Scenario 3: Manufacturing Process Optimization

You're optimizing a multi-stage manufacturing process:

a) Create an algorithm to schedule different manufacturing steps across available machines, ensuring no conflicts and maximizing throughput.
b) Extend the solution to handle maintenance windows and varying processing times for different product types.
c) Develop a feature to dynamically adjust the schedule in real-time based on machine breakdowns or rush orders.

### Scenario 4: Employee Shift Scheduling

You're creating a shift scheduling system:

a) Implement an algorithm to assign shifts while meeting various constraints.
b) Extend the solution to handle larger teams with more complex schedules.
c) Modify the algorithm to balance workload and employee preferences.

# Constraints

- Board size: 9x9 (Classic), 16x16 (Hexadoku)
- Time limit: 10 seconds

# Notes

- Sudoku solving typically uses backtracking with various optimizations.
- Consider techniques like constraint propagation to improve efficiency.
- For larger or more complex variants, consider using advanced techniques like dancing links or SAT solvers.
- In real-world applications, the core concepts of Sudoku solving (constraint satisfaction) can be applied to various scheduling and resource allocation problems.
