2. **N-Queens II**: Count the number of solutions for an NxN board.
3. **N-Queens with Obstacles**: Solve N-Queens with some cells blocked.

### Real-Life Scenario: Satellite Deployment

You're planning satellite deployments:

a) Develop an algorithm to position satellites without signal interference.
b) Modify the algorithm to count possible configurations for resource allocation.
c) Extend the solution to handle areas with signal-blocking terrain.
