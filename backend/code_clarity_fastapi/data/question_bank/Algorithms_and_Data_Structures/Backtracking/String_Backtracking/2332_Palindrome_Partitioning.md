- **Title**: Palindrome Partitioning
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Category**: Backtracking
- **Subcategory**: String Backtracking

# Problem Description

Given a string s, partition s such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome. Return all possible palindrome partitioning of s.

# Versions

1. **All Partitions**: Find all possible palindrome partitions.
2. **Minimum Cuts**: Find the minimum cuts needed for palindrome partitioning.
3. **Longest Palindromic Subsequence**: Find the longest palindromic subsequence.

# Real-Life Scenario: DNA Sequence Analysis

You're developing a tool for genetic research:

a) Implement an algorithm to find all palindromic sequences in a DNA strand.
b) Modify the algorithm to find the minimum number of cuts to create palindromic segments.
c) Develop a feature to identify the longest palindromic pattern in genetic sequences.

# Notes

- These problems are typically solved using backtracking techniques.
- Consider optimizations like pruning and dynamic programming for efficiency.
- In real-world applications, additional constraints and larger data sets may require more sophisticated approaches.
- Many of these problems have applications in optimization, scheduling, and pattern recognition tasks.
