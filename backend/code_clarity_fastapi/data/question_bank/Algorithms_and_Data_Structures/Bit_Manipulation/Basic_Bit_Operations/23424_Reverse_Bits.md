# Problem Description

Given an unsigned integer, reverse the bits of its binary representation and return the resulting number.

# Versions

## Version 1: LeetCode 190 - Reverse Bits

Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

Example:
```
Input: n = 43261596 (represented in binary as 00000010100101000001111010011100)
Output: 964176192 (represented in binary as 00111001011110000010100101000000)
```

## Version 2: HackerRank - Flipping bits

You will be given a list of 32 bit unsigned integers. Flip all the bits (1→0 and 0→1) and return the result as an unsigned integer.

Example:
```
Input: 2147483647
Output: 2147483648
Explanation: 
2147483647 is 01111111111111111111111111111111
Flipping all bits gives 10000000000000000000000000000000
```

## Version 3: CodeChef - REVBIN

Given a number N, reverse its binary representation and print the new number obtained.

Example:
```
Input: 11
Output: 13
Explanation:
11 in binary is 1011
Reversing gives 1101, which is 13 in decimal
```

## Version 4: SPOJ - BINSTREV

Given a positive integer N, find the value of N with its binary representation reversed.

Example:
```
Input: 13
Output: 11
Explanation:
13 in binary is 1101
Reversing gives 1011, which is 11 in decimal
```

## Version 5: Real-Life Applications

### Scenario 1: Digital Signal Processing
You're working on a digital signal processing application:
a) Implement a bit reversal algorithm for Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
b) Optimize the algorithm for real-time audio processing.
c) Extend the algorithm to handle different bit depths (8-bit, 16-bit, 24-bit).

### Scenario 2: Image Processing
You're developing an image processing library:
a) Implement a bit reversal function for image rotation and mirroring.
b) Optimize the algorithm for large, high-resolution images.
c) Extend the functionality to handle different color depths and formats (RGB, RGBA, grayscale).

### Scenario 3: Cryptography
You're designing a simple encryption scheme:
a) Use bit reversal as part of a block cipher algorithm.
b) Implement a key generation method based on bit reversal.
c) Analyze the security implications of using bit reversal in cryptography.

### Scenario 4: Data Compression
You're working on a custom data compression algorithm:
a) Use bit reversal to create a simple dictionary-based compression scheme.
b) Implement a method to quickly identify patterns that benefit from bit reversal.
c) Analyze the compression ratio improvements gained by incorporating bit reversal.

# Constraints

- For Version 1 (LeetCode):
  - The input must be a binary string of length 32

- For Version 2 (HackerRank):
  - 1 <= T <= 100
  - 0 <= N <= 2^32 - 1

- For Version 3 (CodeChef):
  - 1 <= T <= 1000
  - 0 <= N <= 10^9

- For Version 4 (SPOJ):
  - 1 <= N <= 10^9

- For Version 5 (Real-Life Scenarios):
  - Consider optimizing for both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures
  - Handle large inputs efficiently (e.g., for image processing)

# Notes

- Consider the efficiency of your algorithm, especially for larger inputs or when processing needs to be done in real-time.
- Be aware of the differences between logical right shift and arithmetic right shift in different programming languages.
- For cryptographic applications, be cautious about potential vulnerabilities introduced by patterns in bit reversal.
- In image processing, bit reversal can be used for various transformations and can be optimized using lookup tables for better performance.
- For FFT applications, efficient bit reversal is crucial for overall algorithm performance.
- When dealing with different bit depths or data types, ensure your algorithm handles edge cases correctly (e.g., sign bit in signed integers).
- In data compression, bit reversal can be used as part of more complex algorithms to identify and encode patterns efficiently.
