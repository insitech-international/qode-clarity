# Problem Description

Given an integer n, return an array ans of length n + 1 such that for each i (0 <= i <= n), ans[i] is the number of 1's in the binary representation of i.

# Versions

## Version 1: LeetCode 338 - Counting Bits

Implement a function that takes an integer n and returns an array of length n + 1 such that for each i (0 <= i <= n), the array element is the number of 1's in the binary representation of i.

Example:

```
Input: n = 5
Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]
Explanation:
0 --> 0     (0 ones)
1 --> 1     (1 one)
2 --> 10    (1 one)
3 --> 11    (2 ones)
4 --> 100   (1 one)
5 --> 101   (2 ones)
```

## Version 2: HackerRank - Counting Bits

Given a positive integer n, find the total number of set bits (1's) in the binary representations of all numbers from 1 to n, inclusive.

Example:

```
Input: n = 3
Output: 4
Explanation:
1 --> 1     (1 one)
2 --> 10    (1 one)
3 --> 11    (2 ones)
Total: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4
```

## Version 3: CodeForces - Petr and a Combination Lock

Petr has a combination lock with n wheels, each with numbers from 0 to 359. He needs to find if there's a way to rotate the wheels so that the sum of rotations is divisible by 360. This can be solved using a bit manipulation approach similar to counting bits.

Example:

```
Input: n = 3, rotations = [120, 120, 120]
Output: Yes
Explanation: If we rotate all wheels, 120 + 120 + 120 = 360, which is divisible by 360.
```

## Version 4: SPOJ - FINDBIT

Given a range [L, R], find the number with the maximum number of set bits in its binary representation within this range.

Example:

```
Input: L = 5, R = 10
Output: 7
Explanation:
5 --> 101  (2 ones)
6 --> 110  (2 ones)
7 --> 111  (3 ones)
8 --> 1000 (1 one)
9 --> 1001 (2 ones)
10 -> 1010 (2 ones)
7 has the maximum number of set bits (3) in the range [5, 10].
```

## Version 5: Real-Life Applications

### Scenario 1: Error Detection in Data Transmission

You're designing an error detection system for data transmission:
a) Implement a function to calculate the parity bit for each byte of data.
b) Develop an algorithm to detect and correct single-bit errors using Hamming code.
c) Analyze the trade-off between error detection capability and overhead for different bit-counting schemes.

### Scenario 2: Database Query Optimization

You're optimizing a database system that uses bitmap indices:
a) Implement an efficient algorithm to count set bits in large bitmap indices.
b) Develop a method to estimate the selectivity of queries based on bit counts.
c) Design a compression scheme for sparse bitmaps based on bit-counting techniques.

### Scenario 3: Digital Image Processing

You're working on an image processing application:
a) Implement a function to count the number of active pixels in binary images.
b) Develop an algorithm for efficient connected component labeling using bit manipulation.
c) Create a method for image segmentation based on pixel intensity distributions using bit-counting techniques.

### Scenario 4: Network Packet Analysis

You're building a network monitoring tool:
a) Implement a function to analyze the distribution of IP addresses in network traffic.
b) Develop an algorithm to detect potential DDoS attacks based on IP address patterns.
c) Create a method for efficient subnet mask calculations using bit-counting techniques.

# Notes

- Consider using dynamic programming to optimize the solution for larger inputs.
- The concept of "population count" or "Hamming weight" is central to many bit-counting problems.
- In hardware implementations, some processors have specific instructions for counting bits (e.g., POPCNT).
- For large-scale applications, consider using lookup tables or other precomputation techniques to improve performance.
- In database systems, efficient bit counting is crucial for bitmap index operations and query optimization.
- For error detection and correction, understanding bit patterns and counts is fundamental to implementing robust systems.
- In image processing, bit counting techniques can be used for various tasks including feature extraction and image analysis.
