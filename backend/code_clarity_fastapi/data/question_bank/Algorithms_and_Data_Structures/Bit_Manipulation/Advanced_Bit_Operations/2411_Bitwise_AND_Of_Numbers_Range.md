# Problem Description

Given two integers `left` and `right` that represent the range [left, right], return the bitwise AND of all numbers in this range, inclusive.

# Versions

## Version 1: LeetCode 201 - Bitwise AND of Numbers Range

Implement a function that takes two integers `left` and `right` and returns the bitwise AND of all numbers in the range [left, right], inclusive.

Example:

```
Input: left = 5, right = 7
Output: 4
Explanation:
5 = 0101
6 = 0110
7 = 0111
The bitwise AND of all numbers is 0100 = 4
```

## Version 2: HackerRank - AND Product

You are given two integers, a and b. Find the AND product of all integers in the range a to b, inclusive.

Example:

```
Input: a = 12, b = 15
Output: 12
Explanation:
12 = 1100
13 = 1101
14 = 1110
15 = 1111
The AND product is 1100 = 12
```

## Version 3: CodeForces - Bitwise AND and OR

You are given an array of n integers. For each pair of adjacent elements (a[i], a[i+1]), calculate:

1. The bitwise AND of all numbers in the range [a[i], a[i+1]]
2. The bitwise OR of all numbers in the range [a[i], a[i+1]]

Return the sum of all calculated AND values and the sum of all calculated OR values.

Example:

```
Input: [1, 3, 5]
Output: AND Sum = 1, OR Sum = 7
Explanation:
Range [1, 3]: AND = 1, OR = 3
Range [3, 5]: AND = 1, OR = 7
```

## Version 4: GeeksforGeeks - Bitwise AND in Range

Given a range [m, n] where 0 <= m <= n <= 2147483647, return the bitwise AND of all numbers in this range, inclusive. Implement the solution in O(1) time complexity.

Example:

```
Input: m = 5, n = 7
Output: 4
```

## Version 5: Real-Life Applications

### Scenario 1: Network Subnet Mask Calculation

You're designing a network management tool. Given a range of IP addresses, you need to:
a) Find the common network prefix (using bitwise AND).
b) Determine the subnet mask that covers this range.
c) Identify the broadcast address for this subnet.

### Scenario 2: Memory Management in Operating Systems

You're implementing a memory allocation system. Given a range of memory addresses:
a) Find the largest aligned memory block within this range.
b) Determine the base address for page allocation.
c) Calculate the number of pages that can be allocated in this range.

### Scenario 3: Digital Signal Processing

You're working on a digital signal processing application. Given a range of signal values:
a) Find the common frequency components using bitwise AND.
b) Implement a mask to filter out high-frequency noise.
c) Optimize the calculation for real-time processing.

### Scenario 4: Cryptographic Key Generation

You're developing a cryptographic system. Given a range of possible keys:
a) Generate a master key using bitwise AND of the range.
b) Create a key derivation function based on this operation.
c) Implement a secure key exchange protocol using this technique.

# Constraints

- For Version 1 (LeetCode):

  - 0 <= left <= right <= 2^31 - 1

- For Version 2 (HackerRank):

  - 1 <= a <= b <= 10^15

- For Version 3 (CodeForces):

  - 2 <= n <= 10^5
  - 1 <= a[i] <= 10^9

- For Version 4 (GeeksforGeeks):

  - 0 <= m <= n <= 2^31 - 1

- For Version 5 (Real-Life Scenarios):
  - Consider 32-bit and 64-bit architectures
  - Optimize for both speed and memory efficiency

# Notes

- The key to solving this problem efficiently is recognizing the pattern in the binary representation of numbers in the range.
- For large ranges, a naive approach of performing AND on all numbers will be too slow. Look for optimizations based on the binary representation.
- In real-world applications, this operation can be used for finding common prefixes, which is useful in networking and data compression.
- Consider the time-space tradeoff in your solutions, especially for large ranges or when dealing with multiple ranges.
- For cryptographic applications, be aware of potential side-channel attacks based on timing or power analysis.
- In digital signal processing, bitwise operations can be used for efficient filtering and feature extraction.
