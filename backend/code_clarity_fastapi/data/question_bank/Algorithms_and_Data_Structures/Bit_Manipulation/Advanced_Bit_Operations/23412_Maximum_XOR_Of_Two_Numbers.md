# Problem Description

Given an integer array `nums`, find two numbers in the array such that their XOR is the maximum possible value, and return this maximum XOR value.

# Versions

## Version 1: LeetCode 421 - Maximum XOR of Two Numbers in an Array

Implement a function that takes an integer array `nums` and returns the maximum XOR of any two numbers in the array.

Example:

```
Input: nums = [3,10,5,25,2,8]
Output: 28
Explanation: The maximum XOR is achieved by 5 XOR 25 = 28.
```

## Version 2: HackerRank - Maximizing XOR

Given two integers, l and r, find the maximal value of a XOR b where l ≤ a ≤ b ≤ r.

Example:

```
Input: l = 10, r = 15
Output: 7
Explanation: The maximum XOR value is achieved by 10 XOR 15 = 7.
```

## Version 3: CodeForces - Maximum XOR Secondary

You are given an array a of n positive integers. For each index i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), find the maximum value of a[i] XOR a[j] for all j > i.

Example:

```
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: [7, 7, 7, 0]
Explanation:
For i=1: max(1^2, 1^3, 1^4) = 7
For i=2: max(2^3, 2^4) = 7
For i=3: max(3^4) = 7
For i=4: no elements after, so 0
```

## Version 4: GeeksforGeeks - Maximum XOR Subset

Given an array of integers, find the subset of the array with the maximum XOR value. The XOR value of a subset is the XOR of all elements in the subset.

Example:

```
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: 7
Explanation: The subset {1, 2, 4} gives the maximum XOR value of 7.
```

## Version 5: Real-Life Applications

### Scenario 1: Network Packet Routing

You're designing a network routing algorithm. Given a list of possible routes (represented as integers):
a) Find the pair of routes with maximum XOR distance for load balancing.
b) Implement a routing table using a trie structure for efficient lookup.
c) Design a protocol that uses XOR for both routing and simple error detection.

### Scenario 2: Cryptographic Key Generation

You're developing a secure communication system:
a) Generate a set of keys where any two keys have maximum XOR difference.
b) Implement a key exchange protocol based on the XOR operation.
c) Design a cipher that utilizes the maximum XOR property for encryption and decryption.

### Scenario 3: Data Compression

You're working on a lossless data compression algorithm:
a) Use XOR to find patterns in data for efficient encoding.
b) Implement a dictionary-based compression scheme using XOR relationships.
c) Develop a method to quickly identify the most compressible pairs of data blocks.

### Scenario 4: Machine Learning Feature Selection

You're optimizing a machine learning model:
a) Use XOR relationships to identify non-linear features in the dataset.
b) Implement a feature selection algorithm based on maximum XOR difference.
c) Develop a method to generate synthetic features using XOR operations for better model performance.

# Constraints

- For Version 1 (LeetCode):

  - 1 <= nums.length <= 2 \* 10^4
  - 0 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1

- For Version 2 (HackerRank):

  - 1 <= l <= r <= 10^3

- For Version 3 (CodeForces):

  - 1 <= n <= 10^5
  - 1 <= a[i] <= 10^9

- For Version 4 (GeeksforGeeks):

  - 1 <= n <= 10^5
  - 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9

- For Version 5 (Real-Life Scenarios):
  - Consider scalability for large datasets (millions of entries)
  - Optimize for both time and space complexity

# Notes

- The key to solving this problem efficiently often involves using a trie (prefix tree) data structure.
- For large datasets, consider using bitwise operations to optimize space and time complexity.
- In cryptographic applications, be cautious about potential vulnerabilities introduced by patterns in XOR operations.
- When implementing in hardware, XOR operations are often very efficient and can be parallelized.
- In machine learning, XOR relationships can help identify complex, non-linear patterns in data.
- For network applications, consider the trade-off between routing efficiency and the complexity of the XOR-based scheme.
- In data compression, XOR can be used to identify similarities and differences between data blocks efficiently.
