# Problem Description

Sublist Search, also known as subsequence search or pattern matching, involves finding a smaller list (pattern) within a larger list (text). It's a fundamental problem in computer science with applications in text processing, bioinformatics, and more.

# Versions

## Version 1: Naive Sublist Search

Implement a naive algorithm for searching a sublist within a larger list.

Example:
- Input: text = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], pattern = [3, 4, 5]
- Output: 2 (starting index of pattern in text)

## Version 2: KMP Algorithm for Sublist Search

Implement the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm for efficient sublist searching.

## Version 3: Rabin-Karp Algorithm for Sublist Search

Implement the Rabin-Karp algorithm, which uses hashing for sublist searching.

## Version 4: Boyer-Moore Algorithm for Sublist Search

Implement the Boyer-Moore algorithm, which is efficient for large alphabets.

## Version 5: Sublist Search in 2D Arrays

Extend the sublist search algorithm to find 2D patterns in 2D arrays.

# Real-Life Scenarios

## Scenario 1: DNA Sequence Analysis

A genomics research lab needs to analyze DNA sequences. Design a Sublist Search-based system that can:

a) Find specific gene sequences within larger genomic data
b) Identify repeated patterns or motifs in DNA sequences
c) Support searching with wildcards or ambiguous bases
d) Handle reverse complement sequences automatically

The system should efficiently process genome-scale data, potentially billions of base pairs, and support both exact and approximate matching.

## Scenario 2: Network Intrusion Detection

A network security system needs to inspect network traffic for potential threats. Create a Sublist Search-based algorithm that can:

a) Detect specific byte patterns or signatures in network packets
b) Handle fragmented packets and reassemble them for analysis
c) Support multiple pattern matching simultaneously
d) Adapt to new threat signatures in real-time

The algorithm should process high-speed network traffic in real-time, handling gigabits per second of data across multiple protocols.

## Scenario 3: Version Control Diff Algorithm

A version control system needs an efficient algorithm to compare different versions of files. Develop a Sublist Search-based system that can:

a) Identify common subsequences between two versions of a file
b) Efficiently handle large files with millions of lines
c) Support different levels of granularity (character-level, word-level, line-level diff)
d) Provide meaningful and minimal diff output for easy understanding

The system should work efficiently with large codebases, handling files of various types and sizes, and integrate with existing version control workflows.

# Constraints

- 1 ≤ text.length ≤ 10^4
- 1 ≤ pattern.length ≤ text.length

# Notes

- The naive algorithm has a worst-case time complexity of O(nm), where n is the length of the text and m is the length of the pattern.
- KMP and Boyer-Moore algorithms can achieve O(n+m) time complexity, making them more efficient for large texts.
- Rabin-Karp is particularly useful when searching for multiple patterns simultaneously.
- Consider the specific characteristics of your data (e.g., alphabet size, pattern length) when choosing the most appropriate algorithm.
