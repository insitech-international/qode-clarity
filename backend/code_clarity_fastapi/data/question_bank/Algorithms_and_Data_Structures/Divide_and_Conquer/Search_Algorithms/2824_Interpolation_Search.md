# Problem Description

Interpolation Search is an algorithm for searching for a key in an ordered array that has been uniformly distributed. It parallels how humans search through a telephone book for a name, estimating where in the remaining search space the element might be based on the key values at the ends of the search space.

# Versions

## Version 1: Basic Interpolation Search

Implement the basic Interpolation Search algorithm for searching a key in a sorted array of integers.

Example:
- Input: nums = [10, 12, 13, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 33, 35, 42, 47], target = 18
- Output: 4 (index of target)

## Version 2: Recursive Interpolation Search

Implement a recursive version of the Interpolation Search algorithm.

## Version 3: Interpolation Search for Floating-Point Numbers

Adapt the Interpolation Search algorithm to work with floating-point numbers, handling potential precision issues.

## Version 4: Interpolation Search with Duplicates

Modify the Interpolation Search algorithm to find the first or last occurrence of a key when duplicates are present.

## Version 5: 2D Interpolation Search

Extend the Interpolation Search algorithm to work on a 2D sorted array.

# Real-Life Scenarios

## Scenario 1: Database Query Optimization

A database management system needs to optimize range queries on indexed columns. Design an Interpolation Search-based system that can:

a) Quickly locate the start and end points of a range query
b) Adapt to different data distributions within the index
c) Handle composite indexes with multiple columns
d) Provide efficient searching for both dense and sparse indexes

The system should work efficiently on databases with billions of records and support high-throughput query processing.

## Scenario 2: Network Routing Table Lookup

A network router needs to perform fast IP address lookups. Create an Interpolation Search-based algorithm that can:

a) Quickly find the next hop for a given IP address in the routing table
b) Handle both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
c) Adapt to the distribution of IP address ranges in the routing table
d) Support efficient updates to the routing table

The algorithm should perform millions of lookups per second with minimal latency.

## Scenario 3: Time Series Data Analysis

A financial analysis tool needs to efficiently search through time series data. Develop an Interpolation Search-based system that can:

a) Quickly locate specific timestamps or value ranges in large datasets
b) Handle non-uniform time intervals between data points
c) Adapt to different distributions of values in various financial metrics
d) Support searching across multiple related time series simultaneously

The system should work with terabytes of historical financial data and provide fast insights for real-time trading decisions.

# Constraints

- 1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 10^6
- -10^9 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9
- nums is sorted in ascending order

# Notes

- Interpolation Search has an average time complexity of O(log log n) for uniformly distributed data, but can degrade to O(n) in worst cases.
- It generally outperforms binary search for uniformly distributed data but may perform worse for other distributions.
- The algorithm is sensitive to the distribution of the data and may not work well with highly skewed distributions.
- Consider fallback mechanisms to other search algorithms if the interpolation estimates consistently fall outside the current range.
