# Problem Description

Shell Sort is an in-place comparison sort that generalizes insertion sort by allowing the exchange of items that are far apart. It sorts the array by repeatedly arranging the elements at a specific interval (gap) and progressively reducing this interval.

# Versions

## Version 1: Basic Shell Sort

Implement the basic Shell Sort algorithm using a simple gap sequence (e.g., n/2, n/4, ..., 1).

Example:
- Input: nums = [23, 29, 15, 19, 31, 7, 9, 5, 2]
- Output: [2, 5, 7, 9, 15, 19, 23, 29, 31]

## Version 2: Shell Sort with Optimal Gap Sequence

Implement Shell Sort using an optimal gap sequence (e.g., Ciura's sequence: 1, 4, 10, 23, 57, 132, 301, 701).

## Version 3: Adaptive Shell Sort

Develop an adaptive version of Shell Sort that performs well on partially sorted arrays.

## Version 4: Parallel Shell Sort

Design a parallel version of Shell Sort that can utilize multiple processors or cores.

## Version 5: Shell Sort for Linked Lists

Adapt the Shell Sort algorithm to work efficiently on linked lists.

# Real-Life Scenarios

## Scenario 1: Database Index Optimization

A database management system needs to optimize its index structures. Design a Shell Sort-based system that can:

a) Sort database indexes for faster query processing
b) Handle incremental updates to sorted indexes
c) Optimize for different data types (numeric, string, datetime)
d) Adapt to varying degrees of initial sortedness in the data

The system should efficiently manage indexes with millions of entries and support high-throughput transactional workloads.

## Scenario 2: Embedded Systems Sorting

An embedded system with limited resources needs an efficient sorting algorithm. Create a Shell Sort-based solution that can:

a) Sort sensor data in real-time with minimal memory usage
b) Handle varying data sizes and types efficiently
c) Adapt to different hardware constraints (CPU speed, memory)
d) Provide predictable worst-case performance for safety-critical applications

The solution should be implementable on various microcontroller architectures and optimized for energy efficiency.

## Scenario 3: Numerical Simulation Data Processing

A scientific computing application needs to process large datasets from numerical simulations. Develop a Shell Sort-based algorithm that can:

a) Sort multidimensional data efficiently (e.g., particle positions in 3D space)
b) Handle datasets larger than available memory
c) Provide partial sorting capabilities for finding top K elements
d) Integrate with parallel computing frameworks for distributed sorting

The algorithm should be able to process terabytes of simulation data and support various scientific data formats.

# Constraints

- 1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 5 * 10^4
- -5 * 10^4 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 5 * 10^4

# Notes

- The time complexity of Shell Sort depends on the gap sequence used, but it generally performs better than O(n^2) algorithms.
- Shell Sort is not stable, but it is an in-place sorting algorithm.
- The choice of gap sequence significantly affects the algorithm's performance.
- Shell Sort can be more efficient than other O(n^2) algorithms for medium-sized arrays.
