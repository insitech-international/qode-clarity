# Problem Description

Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the two sorted halves. It's known for its stable sorting, predictable performance, and suitability for sorting linked lists.

# Versions

## Version 1: Classic Merge Sort

Implement the Merge Sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order.

Example:

- Input: nums = [38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10]
- Output: [3, 9, 10, 27, 38, 43, 82]

## Version 2: Merge Sort for Linked Lists

Implement Merge Sort to sort a linked list in ascending order.

Example:

- Input: head = [4->2->1->3]
- Output: [1->2->3->4]

## Version 3: Real-Life Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Big Data Analytics Platform

You're developing a big data analytics platform for a multinational corporation.

**Case 1: Log File Analysis**

The platform needs to process and sort massive log files from distributed systems.

Question: How would you implement an external merge sort to efficiently sort a 1TB log file by timestamp when you only have 16GB of RAM available?

**Case 2: Customer Segmentation**

The marketing team needs to segment customers based on multiple criteria simultaneously.

Question: How would you adapt merge sort to perform a multi-key sort on customer data, prioritizing sort keys in the order: total spend (descending), frequency of purchases (descending), and customer age (ascending)?

**Case 3: Time Series Data Analysis**

Financial analysts need to merge and analyze time series data from multiple sources.

Question: How would you design a system that uses merge sort to efficiently combine and sort time series data streams from 100 different sources, each providing data points at irregular intervals?

## Scenario 2: Operating System Design

You're working on a new operating system for high-performance computing environments.

**Case 1: File System Organization**

The file system needs to maintain a sorted list of file metadata for quick access.

Question: How would you implement an in-memory merge sort for file metadata that can handle millions of files and minimize system interruptions during sorting?

**Case 2: Process Scheduling**

The OS needs to schedule processes based on multiple priority factors.

Question: How would you design a merge-sort-based algorithm that can quickly sort the process queue based on a composite priority score derived from CPU usage, waiting time, and user-defined priority?

**Case 3: Memory Management**

For efficient memory allocation, the OS needs to maintain a sorted list of free memory blocks.

Question: How would you implement a real-time merge sort variant that can keep the free memory block list sorted as blocks are allocated and deallocated, while minimizing the impact on system performance?

## Scenario 3: E-commerce Recommendation Engine

You're building a recommendation engine for a large e-commerce platform.

**Case 1: Product Ranking**

The platform needs to rank millions of products based on a complex scoring algorithm.

Question: How would you use merge sort to efficiently rank products when the scoring algorithm is too complex to use comparison-based data structures like heaps?

**Case 2: Collaborative Filtering**

The recommendation engine uses collaborative filtering on user-item interaction matrices.

Question: How would you adapt merge sort to efficiently sort similarity scores in a collaborative filtering algorithm that needs to process millions of user-item pairs?

**Case 3: Real-time Trending Items**

The platform wants to display trending items in real-time based on recent user interactions.

Question: How would you design a system that uses a merge-sort-based algorithm to maintain a sorted list of trending items that can be updated in real-time as new user interaction data streams in?

# Constraints

- For Version 1:

  - 1 <= nums.length <= 5 \* 10^4
  - -5 _ 10^4 <= nums[i] <= 5 _ 10^4

- For Version 2:

  - The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 5 * 10^4]
  - -10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5

- For Version 3:
  - The input file size can be up to several GB
  - Each line in the input file contains a single integer
  - Available memory is limited (specified by memory_limit)

# Notes

- Merge Sort has a time complexity of O(n log n) for all cases, making it more efficient than algorithms like Bubble Sort or Insertion Sort for larger datasets.
- The space complexity of Merge Sort is O(n), which can be a drawback when working with large datasets in memory-constrained environments.
- Merge Sort is stable, meaning that it preserves the relative order of equal elements.
- For small arrays (typically less than 10-20 elements), consider using Insertion Sort instead, as it has better performance for small n due to lower constant factors.
- When implementing Merge Sort for linked lists, you can achieve O(1) extra space complexity by cleverly manipulating pointers.
- In the external sorting scenario, the key is to efficiently manage I/O operations. Consider using buffered reading and writing to improve performance.
- Merge Sort is naturally suited for parallel processing. In multi-threaded environments, different parts of the array can be sorted concurrently.
- For very large datasets, consider hybrid approaches like Timsort, which combines the strengths of Merge Sort and Insertion Sort.
- When implementing Merge Sort, be cautious of off-by-one errors, especially when calculating midpoints and managing array indices.

Merge Sort is a powerful and flexible sorting algorithm that can be adapted to various scenarios, from in-memory sorting of arrays and linked lists to external sorting of large datasets. Its consistent O(n log n) time complexity and stability make it a popular choice in many applications, especially when predictable performance is required.
