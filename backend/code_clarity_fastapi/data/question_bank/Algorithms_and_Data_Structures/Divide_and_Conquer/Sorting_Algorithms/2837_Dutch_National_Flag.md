# Problem Description

The Dutch National Flag problem involves sorting an array of objects of three distinct types (or colors). The goal is to arrange these objects in a specific order, typically with all objects of each type grouped together.

# Versions

## Version 1: Basic Three-Way Partitioning

Implement the basic Dutch National Flag algorithm to sort an array containing three distinct values.

Example:
- Input: nums = [2, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 2, 1]
- Output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]

## Version 2: Generalized k-Way Partitioning

Extend the algorithm to handle k distinct values instead of just three.

## Version 3: Stable Three-Way Partitioning

Modify the algorithm to maintain the relative order of elements within each group.

## Version 4: External Three-Way Partitioning

Adapt the algorithm to work with large datasets that don't fit into memory.

## Version 5: Parallel Three-Way Partitioning

Develop a parallel version of the Dutch National Flag algorithm that can utilize multiple processors or cores.
