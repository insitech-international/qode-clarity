## Problem Description

The Karatsuba algorithm is a fast multiplication algorithm that uses a divide and conquer approach to multiply two numbers. It's more efficient than the classical algorithm for large numbers, reducing the multiplication of two n-digit numbers to at most 3n^(log_2(3)) ≈ 3n^1.585 single-digit multiplications.

## Versions

### Version 1: Basic Karatsuba Multiplication

Implement the Karatsuba algorithm to multiply two large integers represented as strings.

Example:

- Input: num1 = "1234", num2 = "5678"
- Output: "7006652"
- Explanation: 1234 * 5678 = 7006652

### Version 2: Karatsuba for Polynomial Multiplication

Extend the Karatsuba algorithm to multiply two polynomials efficiently.

Example:

- Input: 
  poly1 = [1, 2, 3]  # represents 1 + 2x + 3x^2
  poly2 = [4, 5]     # represents 4 + 5x
- Output: [4, 13, 22, 15]  # represents 4 + 13x + 22x^2 + 15x^3

## Constraints

- For Version 1:
  - 1 <= num1.length, num2.length <= 10^4
  - num1 and num2 consist of digits only
  - Both num1 and num2 do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself

- For Version 2:
  - 1 <= poly1.length, poly2.length <= 1000
  - -10^6 <= poly1[i], poly2[i] <= 10^6

- For Version 3:
  - 1 <= m < n
  - 1 <= e < n
  - n is the product of two prime numbers

## Notes

- The Karatsuba algorithm works by splitting the numbers into two halves and recursively computing products of these halves.
- The key idea is to reduce the number of multiplications by clever algebraic manipulation.
- For very large numbers, consider using a more advanced algorithm like Schönhage–Strassen algorithm or Fürer's algorithm.
- In practice, the Karatsuba algorithm is often used as a subroutine in more complex multiplication algorithms.
- When implementing Karatsuba for polynomials, pay attention to the correct handling of polynomial degrees and coefficient operations.
- For the RSA scenario, remember that the security of RSA relies on the difficulty of factoring large numbers. In practice, much larger primes are used.
- The Karatsuba algorithm shines when dealing with very large numbers or polynomials. For smaller inputs, the classical multiplication method might be faster due to lower constant factors.
- Consider using bitwise operations and other optimizations to improve the performance of your implementation.

## Sample Implementation (Python)

Here's a basic implementation of the Karatsuba algorithm for integer multiplication:

```python
def karatsuba(x, y):
    if x < 10 or y < 10:
        return x * y
    
    n = max(len(str(x)), len(str(y)))
    m = n // 2
    
    high1, low1 = divmod(x, 10**m)
    high2, low2 = divmod(y, 10**m)
    
    z0 = karatsuba(low1, low2)
    z1 = karatsuba((low1 + high1), (low2 + high2))
    z2 = karatsuba(high1, high2)
    
    return (z2 * 10**(2*m)) + ((z1 - z2 - z0) * 10**m) + z0

# Example usage
num1 = 1234
num2 = 5678
result = karatsuba(num1, num2)
print(f"{num1} * {num2} = {result}")
```

This implementation demonstrates the basic Karatsuba algorithm for integer multiplication. For the polynomial multiplication and RSA encryption scenarios, you would need to modify this base implementation to handle the specific requirements of each case.
