## Problem Description

Prime numbers are natural numbers greater than 1 that are only divisible by 1 and themselves. They play a crucial role in number theory and have numerous applications in computer science and other fields. This problem set explores various aspects of prime numbers, from basic identification to advanced applications.

## Versions

### Version 1: Prime Number Generation

Implement an efficient algorithm to generate all prime numbers up to a given number n.

Example:

- Input: n = 20
- Output: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]

Constraints:

- 2 <= n <= 10^8

Implementation Notes:

- Consider using the Sieve of Eratosthenes for efficient prime generation.
- For very large n, consider segmented sieve or other memory-efficient variants.

### Version 2: Primality Testing

Implement a function to determine whether a given number is prime. The function should be efficient for large numbers.

Example:

- Input: 104729
- Output: True (104729 is prime)
- Input: 104730
- Output: False (104730 is not prime)

Constraints:

- 2 <= n <= 10^18

Implementation Notes:

- For small numbers, trial division is sufficient.
- For larger numbers, consider probabilistic primality tests like Miller-Rabin.
- Implement deterministic variants for numbers up to 2^64 for guaranteed accuracy.

### Version 3: Prime Factorization

Given a number n, find its prime factorization.

Example:

- Input: 84
- Output: [2, 2, 3, 7] (as 84 = 2^2 _ 3 _ 7)

Constraints:

- 2 <= n <= 10^18

Implementation Notes:

- Use trial division for small factors.
- For larger factors, implement Pollard's rho algorithm or quadratic sieve.
- Consider precomputing primes up to sqrt(n) for efficiency.

### Version 4: Counting Primes in Intervals

Develop an algorithm to count the number of primes in a given interval [L, R].

Example:

- Input: L = 10^9, R = 10^9 + 10^6
- Output: Number of primes in this interval

Constraints:

- 2 <= L <= R <= 10^18
- R - L <= 10^6

Implementation Notes:

- Use segmented sieve of Eratosthenes.
- Optimize by only considering prime factors up to sqrt(R).

### Version 5: Real-Life Applications

#### Scenario 1: Cryptographic Key Generation

Implement a secure prime number generator for use in RSA encryption. Generate two distinct prime numbers p and q of a specified bit length, ensuring they meet additional security criteria.

Input:

- Bit length: 1024
- Additional criteria:
  - |p - q| should be large
  - (p-1) and (q-1) should have large prime factors

Output: Two suitable prime numbers p and q

Implementation Notes:

- Use probabilistic primality tests with multiple rounds for high confidence.
- Implement checks for various attacks (e.g., Fermat factorization).

#### Scenario 2: Hash Table Design

Design a hash table that uses prime numbers to minimize collisions. Given a dataset size, choose an appropriate prime number for the table size and implement a hash function.

Input:

- Estimated number of elements: 10^6
- Desired load factor: 0.7

Output:

- Recommended table size (a prime number)
- Hash function implementation

Implementation Notes:

- Find a prime number slightly larger than (estimated elements / load factor).
- Implement a universal hashing function using the chosen prime.

#### Scenario 3: Quantum Error Correction

In quantum computing, certain error-correcting codes rely on properties of prime numbers. Implement a function to generate suitable prime numbers for constructing a quantum error-correcting code.

Input:

- Desired code distance: d
- Minimum number of qubits: n

Output: A prime number p such that p^2 + p + 1 is also prime, and p^2 + p + 1 >= n

Implementation Notes:

- Implement an efficient search for such prime pairs.
- Consider using parallelization for faster search in large ranges.

#### Scenario 4: Cicada Life Cycle Prediction

Some species of cicadas have life cycles based on prime numbers (e.g., 13 or 17 years). Develop a model to predict emergence years of multiple cicada species.

Input:

- Current year
- List of cicada species with their cycle lengths and last emergence years

Output: Predictions of the next 100 years of cicada emergences, highlighting years with multiple species emerging

Implementation Notes:

- Use properties of least common multiples of prime numbers.
- Optimize for efficient calculation over long time periods.

## Notes

- Prime numbers are fundamental to many areas of mathematics and computer science. A deep understanding of their properties and efficient algorithms for working with them is crucial for many advanced applications.
- When implementing prime number algorithms, always consider the trade-off between time complexity and space complexity. For very large numbers, memory usage can become a significant constraint.
- In cryptographic applications, the security of many systems relies on the difficulty of factoring large numbers or solving the discrete logarithm problem. Keeping up-to-date with the latest developments in prime number theory and factorization algorithms is crucial for maintaining security.
- Prime number generators used in cryptography must be carefully implemented to avoid introducing vulnerabilities. Always use well-vetted libraries or implementations for security-critical applications.
- In real-world applications, consider the specific requirements of your use case. For example, in some scenarios, it might be preferable to use strong pseudoprimes instead of proven primes for performance reasons.
- The distribution of primes is a rich area of study in mathematics. Familiarity with results like the Prime Number Theorem can be helpful in estimating the behavior of prime-based algorithms.

Understanding prime numbers and mastering algorithms related to them opens up a wide range of applications, from theoretical computer science to practical systems design and even insights into natural phenomena.
