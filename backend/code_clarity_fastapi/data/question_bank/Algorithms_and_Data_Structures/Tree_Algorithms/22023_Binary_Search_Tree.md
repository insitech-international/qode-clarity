# Problem Description

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a binary tree data structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. For each node, all elements in the left subtree are less than the node, and all elements in the right subtree are greater than the node. This structure allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

# Versions

## Version 1: Basic BST Operations

Implement a Binary Search Tree with the following operations:
1. Insertion
2. Deletion
3. Search
4. In-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals

Ensure that the BST property is maintained after each insertion and deletion operation.

Example:

- Input: Insert 5, 3, 7, 1, 9 into an empty BST
- Output: A valid BST structure
- Explanation: The resulting tree should satisfy the BST property for all nodes.

## Version 2: BST with Advanced Operations

Extend the basic BST to support the following operations:
1. Find the kth smallest element
2. Find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes
3. Serialize and deserialize the BST
4. Convert BST to a balanced BST

Example:

- Input: A BST with elements 3, 1, 4, 2; find the 2nd smallest element
- Output: 2
- Explanation: The elements in sorted order are [1, 2, 3, 4], so the 2nd smallest is 2.

## Version 3: Real-Life Scenarios

**Scenario 1: In-memory Database Index**:
You're designing an in-memory database system that needs to support fast lookups, range queries, and frequent updates. The system will be used in a high-frequency trading platform where microsecond-level performance is crucial.

a) How would you implement a BST-based index structure that can handle millions of updates per second while maintaining low-latency query performance?
b) Design a mechanism to support efficient range queries in your BST structure. How would you optimize for both small and large range sizes?
c) Implement a strategy for load balancing and parallelizing operations across multiple BSTs to utilize multi-core processors effectively. Consider the challenges of maintaining consistency and handling concurrent modifications.
d) How would you modify your BST to support efficient versioning, allowing the system to query historical states of the data at specific timestamps?

**Scenario 2: Compiler Symbol Table**:
You're building a compiler for a new programming language, and you need to implement a symbol table using a BST structure. The symbol table needs to handle nested scopes, function overloading, and support quick lookups during the compilation process.

a) Design a BST-based symbol table that can efficiently handle nested scopes. How would you manage entering and exiting scopes during the compilation process?
b) Implement a mechanism for handling function overloading in your BST structure. Consider how you would store and quickly retrieve multiple function signatures for the same function name.
c) How would you modify your BST to support quick lookups of partially qualified names (e.g., finding all members of a class given just the class name)?
d) Design a strategy for optimizing memory usage in your symbol table, considering that modern software projects can have hundreds of thousands of symbols.

**Scenario 3: Expression Evaluation Engine**:
You're developing an expression evaluation engine for a spreadsheet application that needs to handle complex formulas with thousands of cells and functions.

a) How would you use a BST to represent and evaluate complex expressions? Consider how to handle different types of operations, functions, and cell references.
b) Implement a mechanism for efficiently updating the expression tree when a cell's value changes. How would you propagate these changes to dependent cells?
c) Design a strategy for handling circular references in your BST-based expression engine. How would you detect cycles and provide meaningful feedback to the user?
d) How would you modify your BST structure to support "lazy evaluation" of expressions, where parts of the expression are only evaluated when needed?

For all scenarios, consider the performance implications of your design choices, potential optimizations, and how to handle edge cases and error conditions. Your solutions should be scalable to handle large datasets and complex operations while maintaining good performance characteristics.

# Constraints

- For Version 1:
  - 1 <= number of nodes <= 10^5
  - -10^9 <= node values <= 10^9

- For Version 2:
  - Same as Version 1
  - 1 <= k <= number of nodes (for kth smallest element)
  - Height of the tree <= 1000 (for lowest common ancestor)

- For Version 3:
  - In-memory database: capable of handling millions of operations per second
  - Compiler symbol table: up to 1 million symbols, nested scopes up to 100 levels deep
  - Expression engine: formulas with up to 10,000 nodes, support for 100+ built-in functions

# Notes

- While a basic BST offers O(log n) average-case complexity for operations, it can degrade to O(n) in the worst case (when the tree becomes skewed).
- Consider implementing self-balancing variants (like AVL or Red-Black trees) for maintaining O(log n) worst-case performance.
- In practical implementations, the choice between recursive and iterative approaches can significantly impact performance, especially for deep trees.
- For large datasets, consider the memory layout of nodes to optimize for cache efficiency.
- In concurrent scenarios, carefully consider synchronization mechanisms to ensure thread safety without sacrificing performance.
- When implementing BSTs for specific use cases, consider augmenting the basic structure with additional information to support specialized operations more efficiently.
