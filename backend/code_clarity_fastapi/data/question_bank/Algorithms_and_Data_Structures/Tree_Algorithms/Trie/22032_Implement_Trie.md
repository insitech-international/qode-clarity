# Problem Description

A Trie, also called a prefix tree, is an efficient tree-like data structure used to store and retrieve strings. It is particularly useful for tasks involving prefix matching, such as autocomplete features or IP address routing. The challenge is to implement a Trie with basic operations and then extend it to support more advanced functionalities.

# Versions

## Version 1: Basic Trie Implementation

Implement a Trie with the following operations:
1. Insert: Insert a word into the trie.
2. Search: Return true if the word is in the trie, false otherwise.
3. StartsWith: Return true if there is a previously inserted word that has the given prefix, false otherwise.

Example:

- Operations:
  1. Insert "apple"
  2. Search "apple" (Output: true)
  3. Search "app" (Output: false)
  4. StartsWith "app" (Output: true)

## Version 2: Advanced Trie Operations

Extend the basic Trie to support the following operations:
1. Delete: Remove a word from the trie.
2. FindAllWithPrefix: Return all words in the trie with a given prefix.
3. Autocomplete: Given a prefix, return the top k completions based on frequency or custom weighting.
4. LongestCommonPrefix: Find the longest common prefix among all words in the trie.

Example:

- Operations:
  1. Insert words: "car", "card", "care", "careful", "egg"
  2. FindAllWithPrefix "car" (Output: ["car", "card", "care", "careful"])
  3. Autocomplete "car" with k=2 (Output: ["car", "care"] assuming equal frequencies)
  4. LongestCommonPrefix (Output: "")

## Version 3: Real-Life Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Search Engine Query Autocomplete**:
You're designing the autocomplete system for a major search engine that handles billions of queries per day. The system needs to provide real-time suggestions as users type, taking into account query popularity and user context.

a) How would you modify the Trie structure to efficiently store and retrieve query frequencies? Consider the trade-offs between memory usage and query speed.

b) Design an algorithm to generate personalized autocomplete suggestions based on user history and global query popularity. How would you balance between personalization and diversity in the suggestions?

c) Implement a mechanism to handle misspellings and typos in user queries. How would you integrate fuzzy matching into your Trie-based autocomplete system?

d) How would you adapt your Trie to support multi-language queries and suggestions? Consider challenges like different character sets and language-specific ranking factors.

**Scenario 2: IP Routing Table Implementation**:
You're building a high-performance IP router that needs to handle millions of routing table entries and perform lookups at line rate for 100Gbps+ networks.

a) Design a Trie-based data structure to efficiently store and query IP routing tables. Consider both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and how to handle prefix matching.

b) Implement a mechanism for fast updates to the routing table, including adding, modifying, and removing routes. How would you minimize disruption to ongoing lookups during updates?

c) How would you optimize your Trie structure to minimize memory usage while maintaining fast lookup times? Consider techniques like path compression or multi-bit tries.

d) Design a strategy to distribute your Trie-based routing table across multiple line cards in a chassis-based router. How would you handle synchronization and load balancing?

**Scenario 3: DNA Sequence Analysis**:
You're developing a system for analyzing large sets of DNA sequences, focusing on identifying common subsequences and variations across multiple genomes.

a) How would you adapt the Trie structure to efficiently store and query DNA sequences? Consider the specific characteristics of DNA data (4-letter alphabet, variable length sequences).

b) Implement an algorithm to find all occurrences of a given subsequence within the stored DNA sequences. How would you handle approximate matches to account for genetic variations?

c) Design a mechanism to identify the longest common subsequence among all stored DNA sequences. How would you optimize this for very large datasets with millions of sequences?

d) How would you modify your Trie to support efficient comparison of two DNA sequences, identifying regions of similarity and difference? Consider applications in genetic variation analysis and evolutionary studies.

**Scenario 4: Natural Language Processing for Chatbots**:
You're building an NLP system for a chatbot platform that needs to understand and generate human-like responses based on a large corpus of conversational data.

a) Design a Trie-based structure to efficiently store and retrieve conversational patterns and responses. How would you handle variable-length phrases and maintain context?

b) Implement a mechanism for generating appropriate responses based on partial user input. How would you use the Trie to predict likely completions of user messages?

c) How would you modify your Trie to support intent recognition in user queries? Consider techniques for mapping variations of phrases to common intents.

d) Design a strategy to continuously update and improve your Trie-based NLP model based on new conversational data. How would you balance between incorporating new information and maintaining consistency in responses?

For all scenarios, consider the scalability of your solutions, how to handle edge cases (such as very long strings, unusual patterns, or data anomalies), and potential optimizations for specific use patterns. Your solutions should be able to handle large datasets and provide consistent performance under various conditions.

# Notes

- The Trie data structure provides O(L) time complexity for insertions and searches, where L is the length of the string.
- Consider memory optimization techniques like compressed tries or adaptive radix tries for large-scale applications.
- For scenarios involving approximate matching or fuzzy search, explore hybrid approaches combining Tries with other algorithms like Levenshtein automata.
- In distributed systems, carefully consider the trade-offs between data partitioning, replication, and query routing when designing Trie-based solutions.
- For real-time applications, explore techniques like incremental updates or lazy evaluation to maintain responsiveness under high update frequencies.
- When dealing with very large datasets, consider disk-based or hybrid memory-disk Trie implementations to handle data that doesn't fit in main memory.
