# Constraints

- Solutions should be efficient and scalable, capable of handling large volumes of text data (up to 1GB).
- Implementations should consider memory constraints and use streaming or chunking techniques where appropriate.
- String operations should be Unicode-aware and handle multi-language text correctly.
- For time-critical operations (e.g., real-time log analysis), consider parallelization and optimization techniques.
- Ensure that solutions are robust against malformed input and edge cases.

# Notes

- Consider using specialized libraries for complex tasks (e.g., Biopython for bioinformatics, NLTK for NLP), but be prepared to implement core algorithms from scratch.
- For pattern matching and text searching, consider advanced algorithms like Aho-Corasick or suffix trees for improved efficiency.
- In cybersecurity applications, be aware of potential evasion techniques and design solutions to be resilient against them.
- For NLP tasks, consider the challenges of different languages and writing systems.
- In data cleaning scenarios, develop strategies for handling missing, inconsistent, or erroneous data.
- For web scraping, be mindful of ethical and legal considerations, including respecting robots.txt and rate limiting.
- In code analysis tasks, consider using abstract syntax trees (ASTs) for more robust parsing and manipulation.
