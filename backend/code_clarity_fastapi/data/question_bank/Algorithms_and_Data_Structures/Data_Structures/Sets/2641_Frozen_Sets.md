# Problem Description

Frozen sets in Python are immutable versions of regular sets. They provide a way to create sets that cannot be modified after creation, which is useful for maintaining data integrity and creating hashable collections. This problem focuses on understanding and utilizing frozen sets effectively.

# Versions

## Version 1: Basic Frozen Set Operations

Implement a class that demonstrates the following basic frozen set operations:
1. Create a frozen set from a list or regular set
2. Attempt to modify the frozen set (should raise an error)
3. Use the frozen set as a dictionary key
4. Perform set operations (union, intersection, difference) with other sets or frozen sets

Example:
```python
frozen_ops = FrozenSetOps()
fs1 = frozen_ops.create([1, 2, 3, 3, 4])
print(fs1)  # frozenset({1, 2, 3, 4})

try:
    frozen_ops.modify(fs1, 5)  # Should raise TypeError
except TypeError as e:
    print(e)  # 'frozenset' object does not support item assignment

d = frozen_ops.use_as_key(fs1, "value")
print(d)  # {frozenset({1, 2, 3, 4}): "value"}

fs2 = frozen_ops.create({3, 4, 5})
print(frozen_ops.union(fs1, fs2))  # frozenset({1, 2, 3, 4, 5})
print(frozen_ops.intersection(fs1, fs2))  # frozenset({3, 4})
print(frozen_ops.difference(fs1, fs2))  # frozenset({1, 2})
```

## Version 2: Frozen Set in Caching

Implement a caching system that uses frozen sets as keys. The system should:
1. Accept a list of items and return a cached result if available
2. Store new results with the frozen set of items as the key
3. Handle collisions when different orders of the same items are provided

Example:
```python
cache = FrozenSetCache()

result1 = cache.get_or_compute([1, 2, 3], lambda x: sum(x))
print(result1)  # 6 (computed)

result2 = cache.get_or_compute([3, 2, 1], lambda x: sum(x))
print(result2)  # 6 (retrieved from cache)

result3 = cache.get_or_compute([1, 2, 3, 4], lambda x: sum(x))
print(result3)  # 10 (computed)

print(cache.cache_info())  # {'hits': 1, 'misses': 2}
```

## Version 3: Frozen Set for Configuration Management

Design a configuration management system using frozen sets to represent immutable configuration options. The system should:
1. Allow defining configuration options with default values
2. Create configurations by overriding default options
3. Ensure that configurations cannot be modified after creation
4. Provide a method to create a new configuration based on an existing one with some modifications

Example:
```python
config_system = ConfigSystem({
    'debug': False,
    'log_level': 'INFO',
    'max_connections': 100
})

config1 = config_system.create_config({'debug': True})
print(config1)  # ConfigurationState(frozenset({('debug', True), ('log_level', 'INFO'), ('max_connections', 100)}))

try:
    config_system.modify_config(config1, 'log_level', 'DEBUG')  # Should raise TypeError
except TypeError as e:
    print(e)  # 'ConfigurationState' object does not support item assignment

config2 = config_system.create_derived_config(config1, {'max_connections': 200})
print(config2)  # ConfigurationState(frozenset({('debug', True), ('log_level', 'INFO'), ('max_connections', 200)}))

print(config_system.get_value(config2, 'debug'))  # True
print(config_system.get_value(config2, 'max_connections'))  # 200
```

# Constraints

- For Version 1:
  - The frozen sets can contain any hashable Python objects.
  - The maximum number of elements in a frozen set should not exceed 10^5.
- For Version 2:
  - The cache should be able to handle up to 10^4 unique frozen set keys.
  - The maximum length of input lists should not exceed 1000 elements.
- For Version 3:
  - The configuration system should support up to 100 configuration options.
  - The maximum depth of nested configuration options should not exceed 5 levels.

# Notes

- Frozen sets are particularly useful when you need an immutable set of items, such as when using sets as dictionary keys or in situations where data integrity is crucial.
- While frozen sets themselves are immutable, they can contain mutable objects. Be cautious when using mutable objects within frozen sets, as changes to these objects can affect the set's behavior.
- Frozen sets can be used to create efficient caching mechanisms, especially for functions with unordered arguments.
- In the configuration management system, consider using namedtuples or similar immutable structures to represent the configuration state for improved readability.
- When working with large frozen sets, be aware of the memory implications and consider using generators or iterators for set operations when possible.
- Frozen sets can be useful in multithreaded environments where you want to ensure that a set of data remains constant across different threads.
