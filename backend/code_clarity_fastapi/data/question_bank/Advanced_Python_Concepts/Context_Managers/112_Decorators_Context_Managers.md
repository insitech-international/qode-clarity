# Problem Description

Imagine you're developing a sophisticated logging and monitoring system for a large-scale distributed application. This system needs to handle various tasks efficiently and securely, such as managing file operations, handling errors, redirecting output, and managing resources. Using context managers as decorators can significantly enhance your ability to handle these tasks elegantly and effectively.

Context managers are typically used with the `with` statement to ensure proper acquisition and release of resources. However, they can also be used as decorators to apply their functionality to entire functions. This approach combines the power of context management with the flexibility of decorators, allowing you to wrap function executions in specific contexts automatically.

By using context managers as decorators, you can create more robust, efficient, and maintainable code. They allow you to focus on core functionality while handling resource management and other cross-cutting concerns seamlessly.

# Versions

**Real Life Scenarios**

## Version 1. Secure File Operations

You're developing a module that handles sensitive data processing. You need to implement:

- Secure file handling for reading and writing confidential data
- Automatic file closure after operations, even if exceptions occur
- Logging of all file operations for audit purposes

Use the built-in `open()` context manager as a decorator to ensure proper file handling. Implement this as a decorator that can be applied to functions that need to perform file operations.

## Version 2. Error Suppression in Data Processing

Your system processes large volumes of data, and you need to implement:

- Graceful handling of specific exceptions during data processing
- Continuation of processing even when certain non-critical errors occur
- Logging of suppressed errors for later analysis

Use the `contextlib.suppress()` context manager as a decorator to handle specific exceptions in data processing functions. This will allow the processing to continue even when certain errors occur.

## Version 3. Output Redirection for Testing

You're enhancing the testing capabilities of your system. You need to implement:

- Capturing of stdout and stderr for analysis during tests
- Redirection of output to log files or string buffers
- Assertion checks on function output without modifying the original functions

Use the `contextlib.redirect_stdout()` and `contextlib.redirect_stderr()` context managers as decorators to capture and redirect output in test scenarios.

## Version 4. Resource Pool Management

You're optimizing resource usage in your distributed system. You need to implement:

- Automatic acquisition and release of resources from a limited pool
- Proper handling of resource exhaustion scenarios
- Timeout mechanisms for resource acquisition

Create a custom context manager that handles resource pool management, and use it as a decorator for functions that require these resources. This custom context manager should handle resource acquisition, release, and potential timeout scenarios.

# Constraints

1. Ensure decorators preserve the original function's metadata (name, docstring, etc.).
2. Implement proper error handling and exception propagation.
3. Design decorators that can accept parameters to customize their behavior.
4. Create reusable and composable decorators that can be stacked with other decorators.
5. Implement context managers that can handle both synchronous and asynchronous operations when used as decorators.
6. Ensure thread safety for decorators used in concurrent environments.
7. Optimize performance to minimize overhead introduced by the context manager decorators.
8. Provide clear and informative error messages and logging capabilities.
9. Implement proper cleanup and resource management, even in case of exceptions.
10. Design decorators that are compatible with Python's built-in functionalities and common libraries.
11. Create decorators that can work with both instance methods and static methods in classes.
12. Implement decorators that can handle both synchronous and asynchronous functions.
13. Ensure compatibility with type hinting and static type checkers.
14. Design decorators that can be easily unit tested and mocked.
15. Ensure all implementations follow PEP 8 style guidelines and best practices for Python code.

# Notes

Key Notes About Using Context Managers as Decorators:

- Context managers can be used as decorators by wrapping the function call within the context manager's `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods.
- The `contextlib.ContextDecorator` class can be used to create context managers that double as decorators.
- When using built-in context managers as decorators, you often need to create a wrapper function that applies the context manager to the decorated function.
- Custom context managers used as decorators should handle both the setup and teardown phases of resource management.
- The `@contextmanager` decorator from `contextlib` can be used to create generator-based context managers that can also function as decorators.
- When using context managers as decorators, consider the scope of the managed resource - it will typically span the entire function execution.
- Error handling in context managers used as decorators should be carefully implemented to avoid suppressing important exceptions from the decorated function.
- Context managers used as decorators can be particularly useful for cross-cutting concerns like logging, timing, and resource management.
- When creating custom context managers to use as decorators, ensure they are reentrant if they might be used in recursive scenarios.
- Consider using `functools.wraps` in your implementation to preserve the metadata of the decorated function.
- Asynchronous context managers can be used as decorators for async functions using the `contextlib.asynccontextmanager` decorator.
- When using context managers as decorators, be mindful of the performance impact, especially for frequently called functions.
- Context managers used as decorators can be combined with other decorators, but be careful about the order of application.
- Testing functions decorated with context managers might require additional setup to properly mock or control the context.
- Consider providing both a context manager and a decorator interface for maximum flexibility in usage.

Remember that while using context managers as decorators can provide elegant solutions for resource management and cross-cutting concerns, it's important to use them judiciously to maintain code readability and avoid unnecessary complexity.
