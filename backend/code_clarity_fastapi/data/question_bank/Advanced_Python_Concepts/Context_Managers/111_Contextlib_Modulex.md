# Problem Description

Imagine you're running a busy restaurant kitchen. You need to manage various tasks efficiently to keep everything running smoothly. Some of these tasks involve setting up and tearing down equipment, ingredients, or workspace. For instance:

Preparing a cooking station: You need to lay out utensils, turn on appliances, and get ingredients ready before cooking. After you're done, you need to clean up, store ingredients, and turn off appliances.
Handling customer orders: You need to take the order, prepare the food, serve it, and then clear the table and reset for the next customer.
Managing inventory: You need to check stock levels, restock shelves, and update records. Afterward, you need to secure the storage area and update your ordering system.
A context manager is like a smart assistant that helps you with these setups and teardowns. It automatically remembers to do the necessary steps at the beginning and end of each task, even if something unexpected happens in between. This ensures that your kitchen stays organized, resources are used efficiently, and potential problems are minimized.

By using context managers, you can focus on the core task at hand (cooking, serving, or inventory management) while knowing that the surrounding setup and cleanup are being handled correctly. This approach makes your kitchen operations more reliable, efficient, and easier to manage.

# Versions

## Version 1. File Operations Scenario

Imagine you're developing a document management system for a large corporation. The system needs to handle thousands of documents daily, including confidential reports, contracts, and employee records. Your task is to design a module that can efficiently read and write these documents while ensuring:

Documents are properly locked to prevent concurrent modifications
All changes are logged for auditing purposes
Files are compressed to save storage space
Access control is enforced based on user permissions
You need to implement a context manager that handles these requirements seamlessly, ensuring that files are always closed and unlocked after operations, even if an exception occurs during processing.

## Version 2. Database Transactions Scenario

Picture a high-volume e-commerce platform that processes millions of transactions per day. Your responsibility is to develop a module that handles order processing, including:

Creating new orders
Updating inventory levels
Managing customer balances
Logging transaction history
You need to implement a context manager that ensures all these operations are treated as a single atomic unit. If any part of the transaction fails, everything should be rolled back to maintain data integrity. The context manager should also handle database connections efficiently, ensuring they are properly closed after each transaction.

## Version 3. Secure Payment Processing Scenario

Envision a payment gateway service that needs to securely process credit card transactions. Your task is to design a system that:

Encrypts sensitive card information
Verifies card details with the bank
Processes the payment
Generates a secure transaction ID
Logs the transaction securely
You need to create a custom context manager that handles the entire payment processing workflow. It should ensure that all sensitive information is properly encrypted throughout the process and that resources are cleaned up even if an exception occurs during payment processing.

## Version 4. Temperature Monitoring Scenario

Imagine you're developing an environmental monitoring system for a large server room. The system needs to continuously monitor temperature levels and alert administrators if they exceed safe thresholds. Your responsibility is to design a module that:

Reads temperature data from sensors
Calculates average temperatures over time
Compares readings against safety thresholds
Sends alerts via email or SMS if thresholds are exceeded
Logs all temperature readings for historical analysis
You need to implement a context manager that manages the connection to the temperature sensors, ensures continuous reading of data, and gracefully handles disconnections or sensor failures. The context manager should also manage any temporary storage of readings before they're logged to the database.

- Ensure compliance with security standards (e.g., encryption for sensitive data).
- Handle potential disconnections or failures gracefully.
- Optimize performance for real-time operations.
- Support historical data tracking and analysis.
- Implement proper scoping and cleanup of temporary resources.
- Provide tools for testing and mocking context manager behavior.

# Notes

```
Key Notes About Contextlib Managers:

- Automatic Resource Management: Contextlib managers ensure that resources are properly allocated and released, reducing the risk of resource leaks.
- Error Handling: They provide a structured approach to exception handling, allowing for more graceful error recovery.
- Code Readability: By encapsulating setup and teardown logic, contextlib managers contribute to more readable and maintainable code.
- Flexibility: They offer reusable patterns for common programming tasks, promoting code reuse and consistency.
- Integration with Built-in Functions: Many built-in Python functions (like open()) are already context managers, making integration seamless.
- Customization: Developers can create custom context managers to solve domain-specific problems, improving code organization and reusability.
- Asynchronous Support: Recent versions of Python (3.10+) support asynchronous context managers, enabling efficient handling of asynchronous operations.
- The @contextmanager decorator allows creating generator-based context managers without defining separate **enter**() and **exit**() methods.
- The closing() function provides a convenient way to automatically close objects that support the context manager protocol.
- The suppress() function helps suppress specific exceptions within a context manager.
- redirect_stdout() and redirect_stderr() functions allow redirecting stdout and stderr within a context manager.
- The ExitStack class enables nesting of context managers, which is no longer supported directly in modern Python versions but can be emulated using ExitStack.
- The NullContextManager class serves as a placeholder when no actual context manager is needed.
- The contextlib.nullcontext object acts as a no-op context manager, returning the input unchanged.
- The contextlib.contextmanager decorator is used to define generator-based context managers.
- The contextlib.ContextDecorator base class provides a foundation for creating context managers that work with the @contextmanager decorator.
- The contextlib.suppress() function allows suppressing specific exceptions within a context manager.
