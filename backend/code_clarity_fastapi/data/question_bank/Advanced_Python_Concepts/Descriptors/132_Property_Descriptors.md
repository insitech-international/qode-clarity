# Problem Description

Imagine you're developing a complex financial modeling system for a major investment bank. This system needs to handle a wide variety of financial instruments, each with its own set of properties, calculations, and validation rules. You need to ensure that all data is properly validated, calculations are performed efficiently, and the system maintains a clean and intuitive API for the quantitative analysts who will be using it.

Property descriptors are a powerful feature in Python that can help you achieve these goals. They allow you to define how attribute access, modification, and deletion are handled at the class level, providing a way to implement data validation, computed properties, and other advanced behaviors while maintaining a simple interface.

By mastering property descriptors, you can create a robust and flexible financial modeling system that ensures data integrity, performs complex calculations transparently, and provides a user-friendly interface for your analysts.

# Versions

**Real Life Scenarios**

## Version 1: Data Validation for Financial Instruments

Implement a property descriptor that ensures all attributes of a financial instrument are properly validated. The descriptor should:

- Check that values are within acceptable ranges (e.g., interest rates between 0 and 100%)
- Ensure that dates are in the correct format and logically valid (e.g., maturity date after issue date)
- Validate that string fields meet specific format requirements (e.g., ISIN codes)
- Raise informative error messages when validation fails

## Version 2: Computed Properties for Portfolio Analysis

Create a property descriptor that implements computed properties for portfolio analysis. This descriptor should:

- Calculate derived values based on other properties (e.g., yield to maturity based on price and coupon rate)
- Update computed values automatically when dependent properties change
- Provide caching for expensive calculations
- Allow specification of the calculation method at the class level

## Version 3: Unit-Aware Financial Calculations

Develop a property descriptor that handles unit conversions and ensures consistency in financial calculations. This descriptor should:

- Automatically convert between different units (e.g., percentages and basis points)
- Ensure that calculations are performed using consistent units
- Provide a way to specify the desired output unit
- Raise errors when incompatible units are used in calculations

## Version 4: Auditing and Change Tracking

Implement a property descriptor that provides auditing and change tracking for sensitive financial data. This descriptor should:

- Log all changes to the property, including the old value, new value, timestamp, and user
- Provide a way to review the history of changes for each property
- Implement access control, allowing only authorized users to modify the property
- Support rolling back changes to a previous state

# Constraints

1. Ensure thread safety for all property operations
2. Implement proper error handling with informative error messages
3. Optimize for performance, especially for frequently accessed properties
4. Ensure compatibility with Python's data model and special methods
5. Handle edge cases like attribute deletion and inheritance
6. Implement proper support for pickling and unpickling
7. Ensure that property descriptors work correctly with `__getattribute__` and `__setattr__`
8. Optimize memory usage, especially for large numbers of instances
9. Implement proper documentation and introspection support
10. Ensure compatibility with different versions of Python (3.6+)
11. Handle potential recursion in property calculations
12. Implement proper garbage collection and resource management
13. Ensure that property descriptors work correctly with metaclasses
14. Optimize for both read and write operations on properties
15. Implement proper support for class-level and instance-level attributes

# Notes

Key points about Property Descriptors:

- Property descriptors are objects that implement the descriptor protocol (`__get__`, `__set__`, and/or `__delete__`).
- The `property` built-in is a convenient way to create property descriptors.
- Property descriptors allow you to customize attribute access, modification, and deletion.
- They can be used to implement computed properties, data validation, and access control.
- Property descriptors are resolved before instance attributes in attribute lookup.
- The `__set__` method allows you to intercept and customize attribute assignment.
- Property descriptors can be used to implement the Observer pattern for attribute changes.
- They can be combined with decorators for more concise syntax (e.g., `@property`).
- Property descriptors can be used to implement lazy attribute initialization.
- The `__delete__` method allows you to customize attribute deletion behavior.
- Property descriptors can be used to implement attribute aliases and redirections.
- They can be used to implement type checking and automatic type conversion.
- Property descriptors can be used to implement attribute documentation (using the `property` function).
- They can be combined with metaclasses for more advanced customization.
- Property descriptors can be used to implement attribute caching and memoization.

Remember, while property descriptors provide powerful customization options, they should be used judiciously to maintain code readability and avoid unnecessary complexity. Always consider whether simpler alternatives might suffice before reaching for property descriptors.
