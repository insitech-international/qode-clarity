## Problem Description

Implement efficient solutions using Python's itertools.combinations for various combinatorial problems and scenarios where you need to generate all possible combinations of a given size from a collection.

## Versions

### Version 1: Subset Sum Problem

Find all subsets of a given set of numbers that add up to a target sum.

Example:
Input: numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], target = 7
Output: [(2, 5), (1, 2, 4), (3, 4)]

### Version 2: Team Formation

Generate all possible teams of a given size from a list of players.

Example:
Input: players = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David", "Eve"], team_size = 3
Output: [("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"), ("Alice", "Bob", "David"), ...]

### Version 3: Password Cracker

Generate all possible combinations of characters to brute-force a password of a given length.

Example:
Input: charset = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", length = 3
Output: ["aaa", "aab", "aac", ..., "zzz"]

### Version 4: Chemical Compound Generator

Generate all possible chemical compounds given a set of elements and a maximum compound size.

Example:
Input: elements = ["H", "C", "O"], max_size = 3
Output: [("H",), ("C",), ("O",), ("H", "H"), ("H", "C"), ..., ("H", "C", "O")]

## Real-Life Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Investment Portfolio Optimization

Use combinations to analyze different portfolio compositions:
a) Generate all possible portfolio allocations given a set of assets.
b) Analyze risk-return profiles for different asset combinations.
c) Implement a simple Monte Carlo simulation for portfolio performance.
d) Generate all possible pairs for correlation analysis between assets.

### Scenario 2: Network Analysis and Graph Theory

Apply combinations to various graph-related problems:
a) Generate all possible edges in a complete graph with n vertices.
b) Implement a simple algorithm to find all cliques of size k in a graph.
c) Generate all possible paths of length k between two nodes.
d) Analyze all possible vertex colorings with c colors for small graphs.

### Scenario 3: Bioinformatics and Genomic Analysis

Utilize combinations for DNA and protein sequence analysis:
a) Generate all possible DNA sequences of length n for primer design.
b) Implement a simple algorithm to find all common subsequences between two DNA strands.
c) Generate all possible amino acid sequences of a given length for protein structure prediction.
d) Analyze all possible mutations of a given size in a DNA sequence.

### Scenario 4: Menu Planning and Recipe Generation

Employ combinations for culinary applications:
a) Generate all possible meal combinations given a set of dishes and a number of courses.
b) Create a recipe suggestion system based on available ingredients.
c) Analyze nutritional profiles for different meal combinations.
d) Generate all possible flavor combinations for a new product development.

### Scenario 5: Cryptography and Code Breaking

Use combinations in cryptographic applications:
a) Implement a simple cipher that uses combination-based key generation.
b) Generate all possible substitution tables for a simple substitution cipher.
c) Analyze the strength of passwords by generating common character combinations.
d) Implement a basic frequency analysis tool for breaking simple substitution ciphers.

## Constraints

- Consider memory usage when generating large numbers of combinations.
- Optimize for both time and space complexity, especially for large inputs.
- Be aware of the total number of combinations (n choose k) and its growth rate.
- Consider using generators for memory-efficient processing of large combination sets.

## Notes

- Remember that itertools.combinations generates combinations in lexicographic order.
- For large inputs, consider using itertools.combinations_with_replacement if repetition is allowed.
- Combinations can be memory-intensive for large inputs; consider processing them one at a time using a generator.
- The number of combinations can grow very quickly; be cautious with large inputs to avoid excessive computation time.
