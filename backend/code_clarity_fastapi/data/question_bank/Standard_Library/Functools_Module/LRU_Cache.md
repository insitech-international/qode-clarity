## Metadata

- **Category**: Standard Library
- **Subcategory**: Functools Module
- **Difficulty**: Medium to Hard

## Problem Description

Implement efficient solutions using Python's @lru_cache decorator for various memoization and caching problems to optimize recursive and computationally expensive functions.

## Versions

### Version 1: Fibonacci Sequence Optimization

Implement an efficient solution for calculating Fibonacci numbers using memoization with the @lru_cache decorator.

Example:
Input: n = 100
Output: 354224848179261915075 (100th Fibonacci number)

### Version 2: Recursive Dynamic Programming

Optimize a recursive solution for the knapsack problem using @lru_cache.

Example:
Input: values = [60, 100, 120], weights = [10, 20, 30], capacity = 50
Output: 220 (optimal value)

### Version 3: Expensive API Calls

Use @lru_cache to optimize a function that makes expensive API calls with repeated parameters.

Example:
@lru_cache(maxsize=128)
def get_weather(city, date):
    # Simulated API call
    time.sleep(2)  # Simulate network delay
    return f"Weather for {city} on {date}: Sunny"

### Version 4: Recursive Tree Traversal

Optimize a recursive tree traversal algorithm using @lru_cache for problems like finding the lowest common ancestor in a binary tree.

Example:
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3 (lowest common ancestor)

## Constraints

- Consider the trade-off between memory usage and computation time
- Be aware of the cache size limitations and potential memory issues for large inputs
- Ensure that cached function results are valid for repeated calls (i.e., function is deterministic)
- Consider using functools.partial for caching functions with some fixed arguments

## Notes

- Remember that @lru_cache uses a Least Recently Used (LRU) strategy for cache eviction.
- Use the maxsize parameter to limit the size of the cache and prevent memory issues.
- Consider using @lru_cache(maxsize=None) for unlimited cache size,
