# Deque Problems

## Metadata

- **Category**: Standard Library
- **Subcategory**: Collections Module
- **Difficulty**: Medium to Hard

## Problem Description

Implement efficient solutions using Python's Deque (double-ended queue) class for various queue, stack, and sliding window problems.

## Versions

### Version 1: Sliding Window Maximum

Find the maximum element in each sliding window of size k in an array.

Example:
Input: nums = [1, 3, -1, -3, 5, 3, 6, 7], k = 3
Output: [3, 3, 5, 5, 6, 7]

### Version 2: Palindrome Checker

Implement an efficient palindrome checker using a deque.

Example:
Input: "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: True

### Version 3: LRU Cache

Implement a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache with O(1) time complexity for both get and put operations.

Example:
cache = LRUCache(2)
cache.put(1, 1)
cache.put(2, 2)
cache.get(1)       # returns 1
cache.put(3, 3)    # evicts key 2
cache.get(2)       # returns -1 (not found)

### Version 4: Undo/Redo Functionality

Implement undo and redo functionality for a text editor using deques.

Example:
editor = TextEditor()
editor.insert("Hello")
editor.insert(" World")
editor.undo()      # "Hello"
editor.redo()      # "Hello World"

## Real-Life Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Stock Price Analysis

Use Deque for financial data processing:
a) Implement a sliding window to calculate moving averages of stock prices.
b) Detect price breakouts by tracking local maxima and minima.
c) Implement a trading strategy based on recent price movements.
d) Analyze order book depth with efficient updates and queries.

### Scenario 2: Network Packet Processing

Employ Deque for network traffic analysis:
a) Implement a circular buffer for recent packet storage and analysis.
b) Detect network anomalies using sliding window statistics.
c) Manage packet queues in a software-defined networking (SDN) controller.
d) Implement a simple round-robin scheduling algorithm for network flows.

### Scenario 3: Image Processing Pipeline

Apply Deque to image processing tasks:
a) Implement a sliding window filter for image smoothing or edge detection.
b) Manage a processing queue for batch image operations.
c) Implement undo/redo functionality for image editing operations.
d) Buffer video frames for real-time processing and analysis.

### Scenario 4: Task Scheduling in Operating Systems

Utilize Deque for OS task management:
a) Implement a multi-level feedback queue for process scheduling.
b) Manage interrupt handling with prioritized interrupt queues.
c) Implement a work-stealing algorithm for load balancing across CPU cores.
d) Design a page replacement algorithm (e.g., Second Chance algorithm) using a circular buffer.

### Scenario 5: Natural Language Processing

Use Deque for various NLP tasks:
a) Implement a sliding window for calculating n-gram probabilities.
b) Design a buffer for streaming text processing with context awareness.
c) Manage beam search candidates in a machine translation system.
d) Implement efficient string matching algorithms (e.g., Aho-Corasick algorithm) using deques.

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ number of elements ≤ 10^6
- Optimize for both time and space complexity
- Consider thread-safety for multi-threaded applications

## Notes

- Remember that Deque supports O(1) time complexity for append and pop operations at both ends.
- Use the maxlen parameter when creating a deque to automatically limit its size (useful for sliding windows).
- Deque can be used as both a stack and a queue efficiently.
- For large datasets, consider using itertools.islice() in combination with deque for memory-efficient sliding window operations.
