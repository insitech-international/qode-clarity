# Problem Description

Implement efficient solutions using Python's Counter class for various counting and frequency analysis tasks.

# Versions

## Version 1: Anagram Groups

Group words that are anagrams of each other using Counter.

Example:
Input: ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]
Output: [["eat", "tea", "ate"], ["tan", "nat"], ["bat"]]

## Version 2: Most Common Elements

Find the n most common elements in a list with their counts.

Example:
Input: [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3], n = 2
Output: [(3, 4), (1, 3)]

## Version 3: Character Frequency Analysis

Analyze the frequency of characters in a string, ignoring whitespace and case.

Example:
Input: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
Output: {'o': 4, 'e': 3, 'u': 2, 'h': 2, 't': 2, 'r': 2, ...}

## Version 4: Subset Counting

Count the number of times each subset of size k appears in a list.

Example:
Input: [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3], k = 2
Output: {(1, 2): 3, (1, 3): 1, (2, 3): 2}

# Real-Life Scenarios

## Scenario 1: E-commerce Product Analytics

Use Counter to analyze product sales data:
a) Find the top N selling products in a given time period.
b) Identify products often bought together (market basket analysis).
c) Calculate the diversity of products in each customer's purchase history.
d) Analyze seasonal trends in product popularity.

## Scenario 2: Text Analysis for Natural Language Processing

Employ Counter for text processing tasks:
a) Generate word clouds based on word frequency in a document.
b) Identify key themes in customer reviews by analyzing frequent word pairs.
c) Compare vocabulary usage across different authors or text genres.
d) Implement a basic spell-checker using word frequency analysis.

## Scenario 3: Network Traffic Analysis

Use Counter for analyzing network packets:
a) Identify the most frequent source and destination IP addresses.
b) Analyze protocol usage patterns in network traffic.
c) Detect potential DDoS attacks by counting request frequencies.
d) Generate reports on bandwidth usage by application or user.

## Scenario 4: Bioinformatics Sequence Analysis

Apply Counter to DNA/protein sequence analysis:
a) Calculate nucleotide or amino acid composition of sequences.
b) Identify over-represented motifs in a set of DNA sequences.
c) Analyze codon usage bias in different organisms.
d) Compare mutation frequencies across different genomic regions.

## Scenario 5: Social Media Trend Analysis

Utilize Counter for social media data processing:
a) Track trending hashtags over time.
b) Analyze user engagement patterns (likes, shares, comments).
c) Identify influential users based on mention frequency.
d) Measure sentiment distribution in responses to specific topics.

# Constraints

- 1 ≤ number of elements ≤ 10^6
- For string inputs, consider Unicode characters
- Optimize for both time and space complexity

# Notes

- Remember that Counter is a subclass of dict, so all dict methods are available.
- Use Counter's most_common() method for efficient top-n queries.
- Consider using Counter.subtract() for comparing or updating counters.
- For large datasets, consider using generators to minimize memory usage.
