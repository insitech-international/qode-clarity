# Problem Description

Implement efficient solutions using Python's DefaultDict class for various data structuring and grouping tasks.

# Versions

## Version 1: Word Frequency in Documents

Create an index that maps each word to the list of documents it appears in, along with its frequency in each document.

Example:
Input: 
doc1 = "the cat and the dog"
doc2 = "the dog and the fish"
Output:
{
    "the": {doc1: 2, doc2: 2},
    "cat": {doc1: 1},
    "and": {doc1: 1, doc2: 1},
    "dog": {doc1: 1, doc2: 1},
    "fish": {doc2: 1}
}

## Version 2: Graph Representation

Implement an adjacency list representation of a graph using DefaultDict.

Example:
Input: edges = [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (2, 4)]
Output:
{
    1: [2, 3],
    2: [1, 3, 4],
    3: [2, 1],
    4: [2]
}

## Version 3: Grouping Anagrams

Group words by their anagram signatures.

Example:
Input: ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]
Output:
{
    "aet": ["eat", "tea", "ate"],
    "ant": ["tan", "nat"],
    "abt": ["bat"]
}

## Version 4: Nested DefaultDict

Implement a nested DefaultDict to represent a hierarchical structure, like a file system.

Example:
Input: ["/home/user/docs/file1.txt", "/home/user/pics/pic1.jpg", "/home/admin/logs/log1.txt"]
Output:
{
    "home": {
        "user": {
            "docs": {"file1.txt": {}},
            "pics": {"pic1.jpg": {}}
        },
        "admin": {
            "logs": {"log1.txt": {}}
        }
    }
}

# Real-Life Scenarios

## Scenario 1: Customer Order Management System

Use DefaultDict to organize customer order data:
a) Group orders by customer, product category, and date.
b) Track product inventory across multiple warehouses.
c) Manage customer loyalty points for different product categories.
d) Analyze order patterns for personalized recommendations.

## Scenario 2: Log Analysis and Event Correlation

Employ DefaultDict for log processing tasks:
a) Group log entries by timestamp, severity, and source.
b) Correlate events across multiple systems or microservices.
c) Track error frequencies by module and error type.
d) Generate hierarchical reports of system activities.

## Scenario 3: Natural Language Processing Tasks

Apply DefaultDict to various NLP problems:
a) Implement a basic n-gram model for text generation.
b) Create a inverted index for fast full-text search.
c) Build a simple autocomplete system based on word frequencies.
d) Develop a basic coreference resolution system.

## Scenario 4: Social Network Analysis

Utilize DefaultDict for social graph operations:
a) Represent user connections and friend networks.
b) Track user interactions (likes, comments, shares) on posts.
c) Implement a simple recommendation system based on mutual friends.
d) Analyze community structures within the network.

## Scenario 5: Bioinformatics Sequence Analysis

Use DefaultDict for genomic data processing:
a) Group DNA sequences by their taxonomic classifications.
b) Implement a k-mer counting algorithm for sequence assembly.
c) Track gene expression levels across different experimental conditions.
d) Analyze protein domains and their occurrences in different organisms.

# Constraints

- 1 ≤ number of elements ≤ 10^6
- Consider memory usage for large datasets
- Optimize for both insertion and lookup operations

# Notes

- Remember that DefaultDict automatically initializes new keys with a default value.
- Consider using lambda functions or other callable objects as default_factory for complex default values.
- DefaultDict can be nested to create tree-like structures efficiently.
- When using DefaultDict with mutable default values (like lists), be aware of potential side effects.
