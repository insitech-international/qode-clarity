# Problem Description

Encryption is a fundamental aspect of data security. This problem focuses on implementing various encryption techniques to protect sensitive data at rest and in transit.

# Versions

## Version 1: Symmetric Encryption

Implement a system for encrypting and decrypting data using a symmetric encryption algorithm (e.g., AES).

Example:
- Input: Plaintext data and a secret key
- Output: Describe the encryption process, key management, and how to securely store and retrieve the encrypted data

## Version 2: Asymmetric Encryption

Implement a public key infrastructure (PKI) system using asymmetric encryption (e.g., RSA) for secure communication.

Example:
- Input: A message to be encrypted and the recipient's public key
- Output: Describe the encryption process, key generation, and how to securely exchange public keys

## Version 3: Hybrid Encryption System

Design and implement a hybrid encryption system that combines symmetric and asymmetric encryption for efficient and secure data transfer.

Example:
- Input: Large data set to be securely transmitted
- Output: Describe the hybrid encryption process, including key exchange, session key generation, and data encryption

## Version 4: Real-Life Domain Cases

### Scenario 1: Secure Messaging Application

You're developing an end-to-end encrypted messaging application.

Tasks:
a) Implement the Signal Protocol or a similar double ratchet algorithm for perfect forward secrecy
b) Design a secure key exchange mechanism for initial communication setup
c) Implement secure storage of message history on user devices
d) Design a system for secure group messaging with forward secrecy

### Scenario 2: Financial Data Protection

You're tasked with securing sensitive financial data for a banking system.

Tasks:
a) Implement encryption for storing sensitive customer data (e.g., SSN, credit card numbers)
b) Design a secure system for encrypting financial transactions in transit
c) Implement a key management system for rotating encryption keys
d) Design a system for secure data sharing between different bank departments or partner institutions

### Scenario 3: Healthcare Data Encryption

You're developing a system to protect patient health information in compliance with HIPAA.

Tasks:
a) Implement encryption for electronic health records (EHR) at rest
b) Design a secure system for sharing encrypted patient data between healthcare providers
c) Implement attribute-based encryption for fine-grained access control to patient data
d) Design a system for securely backing up and recovering encrypted health records

### Scenario 4: Secure Cloud Storage Service

You're building a secure cloud storage service with client-side encryption.

Tasks:
a) Implement client-side encryption to ensure the service provider cannot access user data
b) Design a secure key management system that allows users to recover data if they lose their password
c) Implement secure file sharing between users without exposing encryption keys to the server
d) Design a system for secure and efficient deduplication of encrypted data

### Scenario 5: IoT Device Security

You're developing encryption solutions for a network of IoT devices.

Tasks:
a) Implement lightweight encryption for resource-constrained IoT devices
b) Design a secure key provisioning system for IoT devices during manufacturing and deployment
c) Implement secure firmware updates using code signing and encryption
d) Design a system for secure data aggregation from multiple IoT devices

# Constraints

- For all versions:
  - Use well-established, peer-reviewed encryption algorithms and libraries
  - Ensure proper key management and protection
  - Consider performance implications, especially for resource-constrained environments

- For Version 4 (Real-Life Domain Cases):
  - Comply with relevant data protection regulations and industry standards
  - Consider scalability for systems handling large volumes of data or numerous devices
  - Implement measures to protect against side-channel attacks

# Notes

- Never implement your own cryptographic algorithms; use well-established libraries
- Properly manage encryption keys throughout their lifecycle (generation, storage, rotation, destruction)
- Use appropriate key lengths and encryption modes as recommended by security standards
- Implement proper random number generation for cryptographic operations
- Consider the impact of quantum computing on current encryption methods and plan for quantum-resistant algorithms
- Regularly audit and update encryption implementations to address new vulnerabilities
- Implement proper error handling that doesn't reveal sensitive information about the encryption process
- Consider using hardware security modules (HSM) for critical key management operations
- Stay informed about the latest developments in cryptography and encryption standards
