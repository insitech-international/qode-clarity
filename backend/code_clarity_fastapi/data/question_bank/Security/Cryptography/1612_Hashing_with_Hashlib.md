# Problem Description

Hashing is a fundamental technique in computer science and cryptography, used for data integrity verification, password storage, and many other applications. This problem focuses on implementing various hashing techniques using Python's hashlib library and applying them to real-world scenarios.

# Versions

## Version 1: Basic Hashing

Implement a system to hash data using different algorithms provided by hashlib (e.g., MD5, SHA-256).

Example:

- Input: A string to be hashed and the choice of hashing algorithm
- Output: Describe the hashing process and return the hash digest

## Version 2: Password Hashing

Implement a secure password hashing system using a strong algorithm (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) with salt.

Example:

- Input: A password to be hashed
- Output: Describe the secure hashing process, including salt generation, and return the hash

## Version 3: Data Integrity Verification

Implement a file integrity checking system using hashing.

Example:

- Input: A file to be verified and its previously calculated hash
- Output: Describe the process of calculating and verifying the file's hash

## Version 4: Real-Life Domain Cases

### Scenario 1: User Authentication System

You're building a user authentication system for a web application.

Tasks:
a) Implement secure password hashing for user registration and login
b) Design a password reset mechanism that doesn't expose the original password
c) Implement a system to prevent rainbow table attacks
d) Design a mechanism to gradually upgrade password hashes as stronger algorithms become available

### Scenario 2: Digital Signature System

You're developing a digital signature system for a document management platform.

Tasks:
a) Implement a hash-based digital signature scheme
b) Design a system for verifying the integrity and authenticity of signed documents
c) Implement a timestamp mechanism to prove when a document was signed
d) Design a key management system for signing keys

### Scenario 3: Blockchain Implementation

You're creating a simple blockchain system for a supply chain management application.

Tasks:
a) Implement block hashing using SHA-256
b) Design a proof-of-work system based on hash difficulty
c) Implement a mechanism for verifying the integrity of the entire blockchain
d) Design a system for handling blockchain forks and conflicts

### Scenario 4: Data Deduplication System

You're building a data deduplication system for a cloud storage service.

Tasks:
a) Implement content-based chunking using rolling hash functions
b) Design a system for identifying duplicate chunks using secure hash comparisons
c) Implement a mechanism for reconstructing files from deduplicated chunks
d) Design a system for handling hash collisions in the deduplication process

### Scenario 5: Secure Log Management

You're developing a secure logging system for a financial institution.

Tasks:
a) Implement tamper-evident logging using hash chaining
b) Design a system for efficiently verifying the integrity of large log files
c) Implement a mechanism for securely truncating old log entries while maintaining verifiability
d) Design a system for distributed log verification in a multi-server environment

# Constraints

- For all versions:

  - Use appropriate hash functions for each use case (e.g., cryptographic vs. non-cryptographic)
  - Consider performance implications, especially for large datasets or high-frequency operations
  - Ensure that hashing operations don't inadvertently expose sensitive information

- For Version 4 (Real-Life Domain Cases):
  - Comply with relevant industry standards and regulations
  - Consider scalability for systems handling large volumes of data or numerous users
  - Implement proper error handling and logging without exposing sensitive information

# Notes

- Always use cryptographically secure hash functions (e.g., SHA-256, SHA-3) for security-critical applications
- Be aware of the limitations of hash functions, such as the possibility of collisions
- Regularly update hash functions as new standards and recommendations emerge
- For password hashing, always use specialized password hashing functions (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) instead of general-purpose hash functions
- Implement proper salting and key stretching techniques for password hashing
- Be cautious of timing attacks when comparing hash values
- Consider the impact of quantum computing on current hash functions and plan for quantum-resistant alternatives
- Use constant-time comparison functions when comparing hash values to prevent timing attacks
- Stay informed about the latest developments in hash function security and best practices
