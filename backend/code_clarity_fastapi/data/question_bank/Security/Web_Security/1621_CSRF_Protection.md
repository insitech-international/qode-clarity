# Problem Description

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a type of attack that tricks the victim into submitting a malicious request. This problem focuses on implementing various CSRF protection techniques to prevent such attacks in web applications.

# Versions

## Version 1: Synchronizer Token Pattern

Implement CSRF protection using the Synchronizer Token Pattern.

Example:
- Input: A web form submission request
- Output: Describe the process of generating, embedding, and validating CSRF tokens

## Version 2: Double Submit Cookie

Implement CSRF protection using the Double Submit Cookie technique.

Example:
- Input: An AJAX request to a protected API endpoint
- Output: Describe the process of setting and validating the double submit cookie

## Version 3: SameSite Cookie Attribute

Implement CSRF protection using the SameSite cookie attribute.

Example:
- Input: A set of cookies used in a web application
- Output: Describe how to set and use the SameSite attribute to prevent CSRF attacks

## Version 4: Real-Life Domain Cases

### Scenario 1: E-commerce Platform

You're implementing CSRF protection for a large e-commerce platform with both web and mobile interfaces.

Tasks:
a) Implement CSRF protection for the checkout process
b) Design a system for handling CSRF tokens in single-page applications
c) Implement CSRF protection for the REST API used by mobile apps
d) Design a mechanism to rotate CSRF tokens without disrupting user sessions

### Scenario 2: Online Banking System

You're enhancing the security of an online banking system against CSRF attacks.

Tasks:
a) Implement CSRF protection for fund transfer operations
b) Design a system for handling CSRF protection in multi-tab browsing scenarios
c) Implement CSRF protection for third-party payment integrations
d) Design a mechanism to prevent CSRF token leakage through referrer headers

### Scenario 3: Content Management System (CMS)

You're building CSRF protection for a CMS with user-generated content and admin functionalities.

Tasks:
a) Implement CSRF protection for user actions (e.g., posting comments, liking posts)
b) Design a system for handling CSRF protection in WYSIWYG editors and file uploads
c) Implement CSRF protection for admin panel actions
d) Design a mechanism to handle CSRF protection in plugins and themes

### Scenario 4: Single Sign-On (SSO) System

You're implementing CSRF protection for a SSO system used across multiple applications.

Tasks:
a) Implement CSRF protection for the login and logout processes
b) Design a system for propagating CSRF protection across different domains
c) Implement CSRF protection for OAuth 2.0 authorization flows
d) Design a mechanism to handle CSRF protection in federated identity scenarios

### Scenario 5: RESTful API Gateway

You're building CSRF protection for a RESTful API gateway that serves multiple microservices.

Tasks:
a) Implement CSRF protection for API endpoints that change state
b) Design a system for handling CSRF tokens in stateless API architectures
c) Implement CSRF protection that works with API key authentication
d) Design a mechanism to handle CSRF protection in API versioning scenarios

# Constraints

- For all versions:
  - Ensure CSRF protection doesn't significantly impact application performance
  - Consider compatibility with various browsers and client-side frameworks
  - Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information

- For Version 4 (Real-Life Domain Cases):
  - Consider scalability for high-traffic applications
  - Ensure compatibility with content delivery networks (CDNs) and caching mechanisms
  - Implement CSRF protection in compliance with relevant security standards (e.g., OWASP guidelines)

# Notes

- CSRF protection should be implemented on the server-side; client-side validation can be bypassed
- Use strong, unpredictable token generation methods
- Consider implementing additional security headers like X-Frame-Options to prevent clickjacking
- Be aware of the limitations of each CSRF protection method and choose the appropriate one for your use case
- Regularly audit and update CSRF protection mechanisms to address new attack vectors
- Consider the impact of CSRF protection on legitimate cross-origin requests and implement exceptions carefully
- Educate developers about CSRF risks and proper implementation of protection mechanisms
- Stay informed about the latest CSRF attack techniques and defense strategies
