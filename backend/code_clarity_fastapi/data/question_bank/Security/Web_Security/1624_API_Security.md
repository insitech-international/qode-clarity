# Problem Description

Securing APIs is crucial in modern web applications and services. This problem focuses on implementing various security measures to protect APIs from common vulnerabilities and attacks.

# Versions

## Version 1: Basic API Authentication

Implement a simple API authentication system using API keys. Ensure that all endpoints require valid authentication before processing requests.

Example:
- Input: API request with an API key in the header
- Output: Describe the process of validating the API key and either allowing or denying the request

## Version 2: OAuth 2.0 Implementation

Implement OAuth 2.0 for a multi-service ecosystem. Include different grant types such as Authorization Code, Client Credentials, and Refresh Token.

Example:
- Input: OAuth 2.0 authorization request for a third-party application
- Output: Describe the complete OAuth flow, including token issuance and validation

## Version 3: API Rate Limiting and Throttling

Design and implement a rate limiting system for your API to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.

Example:
- Input: Configure rate limits of 100 requests per minute for free tier users and 1000 requests per minute for premium users
- Output: Describe the implementation of the rate limiting system and how it handles requests exceeding the limit

## Version 4: Real-Life Domain Cases

### Scenario 1: E-commerce Platform API

You're building an API for a large e-commerce platform that needs to handle various operations securely.

Tasks:
a) Implement secure user authentication and authorization for customers and vendors
b) Design a system for securely handling payment information in API calls
c) Implement fine-grained access control for different user roles (customer, vendor, admin)
d) Design a secure API for third-party integrations (e.g., shipping providers, payment gateways)

### Scenario 2: Healthcare Data API

You're developing an API for a healthcare system that deals with sensitive patient data.

Tasks:
a) Implement HIPAA-compliant authentication and authorization
b) Design a system for securely transmitting and storing patient records
c) Implement an audit trail for all data access and modifications
d) Design a secure mechanism for patients to grant temporary access to their data to healthcare providers

### Scenario 3: Financial Services API

You're creating an API for a financial services company that needs to handle sensitive financial transactions.

Tasks:
a) Implement multi-factor authentication for high-risk operations
b) Design a system for secure real-time transaction processing
c) Implement a fraud detection system within the API
d) Design a secure way to handle and store API keys for different financial institutions

### Scenario 4: IoT Device Management API

You're building an API to manage a large network of IoT devices for a smart city project.

Tasks:
a) Implement secure device authentication and provisioning
b) Design a system for securely updating device firmware through the API
c) Implement access controls for different city departments accessing device data
d) Design a secure way to handle real-time data streams from множество devices

### Scenario 5: Social Media Platform API

You're developing an API for a new social media platform that needs to handle user data and interactions securely.

Tasks:
a) Implement secure user authentication with support for social login
b) Design a system for handling user privacy settings and data sharing permissions
c) Implement a content moderation system within the API
d) Design a secure way to handle large-scale real-time events (e.g., live streaming, instant messaging)

# Constraints

- For all versions:
  - All communications must be over HTTPS
  - Implement proper error handling without revealing sensitive information
  - Consider performance implications of security measures

- For Version 4 (Real-Life Domain Cases):
  - Comply with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, PSD2)
  - Consider scalability for millions of users and requests
  - Implement proper logging and monitoring without compromising security

# Notes

- Always use industry-standard encryption for storing sensitive data
- Regularly update and patch all systems and dependencies
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks
- Use secure random number generators for creating tokens and keys
- Consider implementing a Web Application Firewall (WAF) for additional protection
- Regularly perform security audits and penetration testing
- Stay informed about the latest security threats and best practices in API security
