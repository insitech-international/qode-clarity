## Problem Description

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) requests are the foundation of web communication. Efficient implementation of HTTP requests involves understanding various methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.), handling headers and cookies, managing sessions, dealing with authentication, and optimizing for performance and reliability.

## Versions

### Version 1: Basic GET Request

Implement a simple GET request to retrieve data from a web server.

Example:
- Input: URL = "https://api.example.com/users"
- Output: JSON response with user data

### Version 2: POST Request with Data

Send a POST request with JSON data to create a new resource on the server.

Example:
- Input: URL = "https://api.example.com/users", Data = {"name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com"}
- Output: Response with created user details and status code 201

### Version 3: Authentication and Authorization

Implement requests with various authentication methods (Basic Auth, OAuth, JWT).

Example:
- Input: URL = "https://api.example.com/protected-resource", Token = "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
- Output: Protected resource data or 401 Unauthorized if token is invalid

### Version 4: Handling Cookies and Sessions

Manage cookies and maintain session state across multiple requests.

Example:
- Input: Login request followed by accessing a protected resource
- Output: Successful access to protected resource using session cookie

### Version 5: Asynchronous Requests

Implement non-blocking, asynchronous HTTP requests for improved performance.

Example:
- Input: Multiple URLs to fetch data from
- Output: Concurrent retrieval of data from all URLs without blocking

## Real-Life Scenarios

### Scenario 1: E-commerce Platform

An e-commerce website needs to handle various types of HTTP requests:
- Product catalog browsing (GET requests)
- User authentication and shopping cart management (POST, PUT requests)
- Order placement and payment processing (POST requests with sensitive data)
- Real-time inventory updates (WebSocket or long-polling GET requests)

Optimize for:
a) Fast loading of product pages
b) Secure handling of user data and payments
c) Consistent shopping cart state across devices
d) Real-time inventory and pricing updates

### Scenario 2: Social Media Application

A social media app needs to handle complex interactions:
- News feed loading and infinite scrolling (GET requests with pagination)
- Posting updates, comments, and likes (POST requests)
- Real-time notifications (WebSocket or Server-Sent Events)
- Media upload and sharing (POST requests with multipart form data)

Optimize for:
a) Fast and smooth scrolling experience
b) Real-time updates and notifications
c) Efficient handling of media uploads
d) Maintaining user session across app restarts

### Scenario 3: IoT Device Management

An IoT platform needs to communicate with numerous devices:
- Device registration and authentication (POST requests)
- Periodic sensor data reporting (POST requests)
- Device configuration updates (GET and PUT requests)
- Firmware updates (GET requests for large files)

Optimize for:
a) Handling thousands of concurrent connections
b) Minimizing data usage for constrained devices
c) Ensuring secure communication for sensitive data
d) Reliable delivery of critical updates

### Scenario 4: Microservices Architecture

A system built on microservices needs efficient inter-service communication:
- Service discovery and health checks (GET requests)
- Data synchronization between services (POST and PUT requests)
- Event-driven communication (WebHooks or message queues)
- Distributed tracing and logging

Optimize for:
a) Low latency inter-service communication
b) Resilience to service failures
c) Consistent data across services
d) Scalability and load balancing

### Scenario 5: Mobile App Backend

A mobile app backend needs to support various app functions:
- User registration and profile management (POST and PUT requests)
- Content delivery and caching (GET requests with cache headers)
- Push notifications (POST requests to notification services)
- Analytics data collection (POST requests, possibly batched)

Optimize for:
a) Minimizing mobile data usage
b) Supporting offline mode and data synchronization
c) Fast app startup with minimal API calls
d) Handling varying network conditions

## Constraints

- Network reliability: Handle timeouts, retries, and connection errors
- Security: Implement proper encryption (HTTPS) and data validation
- Performance: Optimize for low latency and efficient use of network resources
- Scalability: Design for high concurrent requests (>1000 requests/second)

## Notes

- Always use HTTPS for secure communication, especially when handling sensitive data.
- Implement proper error handling and logging for debugging and monitoring.
- Consider using HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 for improved performance when supported.
- Implement rate limiting and backoff strategies to avoid overloading servers.
- Use appropriate caching strategies (e.g., ETags, Cache-Control headers) to reduce unnecessary requests.
- For mobile apps, consider the impact of network requests on battery life and data usage.
- Implement request queuing and retry mechanisms for improved reliability in poor network conditions.
- Use compression (e.g., gzip) to reduce data transfer sizes.
- Consider using a robust HTTP client library that handles common issues like connection pooling, automatic retries, and cookie management.
- For large-scale systems, consider implementing API gateways for centralized request handling, authentication, and rate limiting.
