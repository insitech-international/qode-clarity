# Problem Description

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) sockets are a fundamental building block for reliable network communication in computer networks. They provide a connection-oriented, stream-based service with guaranteed delivery of packets in the correct order. This problem focuses on implementing and utilizing TCP sockets in Python, exploring their capabilities, and addressing common challenges in socket programming.

The challenge involves understanding the TCP protocol, managing connections, handling data transmission, and dealing with network-related issues such as timeouts and disconnections. It requires a solid grasp of networking fundamentals, concurrent programming concepts, and error handling techniques.
