# Problem Description

Conditional statements allow programs to execute different blocks of code based on conditions or criteria. These statements enable branching logic, enabling programmers to make decisions within their code.

# Versions

## Version 1: LeetCode - String to Integer (atoi)

Implement a function to convert a string to an integer.

Example:

- Input: "42"
- Output: 42
- Explanation: Convert "42" to integer 42.

## Version 2: HackerRank - Conditional Statements Challenge

Given a variable x, determine whether it is even or odd.

Example:

- Input: x = 7
- Output: "Odd"

## Version 3: Real-Life Scenario - Credit Card Validation

Develop a program to validate credit card numbers. Implement a function that checks if a given credit card number is valid based on Luhn's algorithm.

Example:

- Input: "4532015112830366"
- Output: True (valid credit card number)

# Constraints

- For Version 1:

  - Input string contains only ASCII digits 0-9
  - Input string is not empty

- For Version 2:

  - x is an integer

- For Version 3:
  - Input is a string of 16 digits
  - First digit should be 4 (Visa), 51-55 (MasterCard), or 34-37 (American Express)

# Notes

- Common conditional operators include if-else, switch-case, and ternary operators.
- When dealing with credit card validation, remember to handle edge cases like leading zeros or invalid character inputs.
- In real-life applications, consider security implications when handling sensitive information like credit card numbers.
- Always test your code with various input scenarios to ensure robustness.
