# Problem Description

Packages in Python are directories containing related modules. They provide a way to organize and distribute code, promoting better maintainability and scalability in larger projects.

# Versions

## Version 1: LeetCode - Edit Distance

Given two words word1 and word2, return the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2. You have the following three operations permitted on a word:

1. Insert a character
2. Delete a character
3. Replace a character

Example:

- Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "roses"
- Output: 3

## Version 2: HackerRank - Package Structure

Create a package called `data_processing` with submodules for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis. Define functions for each submodule and demonstrate how to import and use them.

Example:

- Input: from data_processing.cleaning import remove_outliers
- Output: Cleaned dataset after removing outliers

## Version 3: Real-Life Scenario - E-commerce Platform

Develop a package structure for an e-commerce platform. Include modules for user management, product catalog, shopping cart, and order processing. Demonstrate how to import and use these modules in a main application.

Example:

- Input: from ecommerce.user_management import create_user
- Output: New user account created successfully

# Constraints

- For Version 1:

  - 1 <= len(word1) <= 500
  - 1 <= len(word2) <= 500

- For Version 2:

  - Ensure proper documentation and example usage for each submodule
  - Use `__init__.py` files to expose only necessary submodules

- For Version 3:
  - Implement proper error handling for database connections and transactions
  - Use dependency injection for services like payment gateways

# Notes

- Packages are created by placing related modules in a directory.
- Use `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml` to define package metadata and dependencies.
- Consider using tools like `pip` and `virtualenv` for managing package installations and dependencies.
- Always test package structures with different import scenarios to ensure flexibility and maintainability.
