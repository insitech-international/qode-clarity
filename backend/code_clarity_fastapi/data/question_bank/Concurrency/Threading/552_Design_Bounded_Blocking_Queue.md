# Problem Description

Imagine you're developing a task management system for a large-scale distributed computing platform. Your job is to design and implement a bounded blocking queue that can efficiently manage a high volume of tasks across multiple worker threads. 

The challenge lies in balancing throughput, fairness, and resource utilization. You need to ensure that:

- Tasks are added to the queue without blocking indefinitely
- Worker threads can retrieve tasks quickly without waiting too long
- The queue size remains bounded to prevent excessive memory usage
- The system gracefully handles cases where workers become unavailable or overwhelmed

A context manager would be useful in this scenario to handle the setup and teardown of the queue efficiently, manage thread safety, and ensure proper cleanup even if the system needs to shut down abruptly.

# Versions

## Version 1: Basic Bounded Blocking Queue

Your task is to implement a simple bounded blocking queue using a threading.Lock. The queue should:

- Allow adding items to the queue
- Allow retrieving items from the queue
- Have a maximum size limit
- Block threads when trying to add items if the queue is full
- Block threads when trying to retrieve items if the queue is empty
- Implement thread-safe operations
- Handle potential exceptions during queue operations

You need to implement a context manager that handles resource acquisition (opening locks), manages concurrent operations, and ensures proper cleanup of resources when the queue is no longer needed.

## Version 2: Advanced Bounded Blocking Queue

Expand upon the basic queue by adding the following features:

- Implement a priority system for task ordering
- Add support for timeout-based retrieval of items
- Implement a mechanism to detect and handle deadlocks
- Add support for worker threads to pause and resume their execution
- Implement a logging system to track queue operations and worker activities
- Add support for dynamically adjusting the queue size based on current workload
- Implement a mechanism to prioritize certain types of tasks over others

Your task is to update the context manager to handle these advanced features while maintaining efficient resource management and thread safety.

## Version 3: Thread Pool Integration

Your task is to integrate the bounded blocking queue with a thread pool. Implement a context manager that:

- Manages a fixed-size pool of worker threads
- Uses the bounded blocking queue for task distribution among workers
- Implements a mechanism to monitor and report thread utilization
- Adds support for prioritizing certain types of tasks
- Implements a graceful shutdown procedure for the entire system
- Adds support for dynamically adjusting the number of active workers based on current workload

Your goal is to demonstrate how context managers can be adapted to work with thread pools while maintaining the benefits of automatic resource management and exception handling.

## Version 4: Asynchronous Queue Implementation

Your task is to refactor the bounded blocking queue to use asynchronous operations instead of multithreading. Implement an async context manager that:

- Uses asyncio to manage concurrent operations
- Implements an asynchronous version of the bounded blocking queue
- Handles task submission and retrieval asynchronously
- Manages connection pooling efficiently
- Implements timeout-based retrieval of items
- Adds support for parallel processing of retrieved tasks
- Implements graceful shutdown handling for long-running tasks

Your goal is to demonstrate how context managers can be adapted to work with asynchronous programming paradigms while maintaining the benefits of automatic resource management and exception handling.

# Constraints

- Ensure proper resource acquisition and release for locks, semaphores, and other synchronization primitives.
- Implement efficient thread synchronization mechanisms to prevent race conditions.
- Provide a structured approach to setup and teardown operations for each component of the queue system.
- Handle potential exceptions and cleanup resources accordingly.
- Offer flexibility for customizing queue behavior and worker configurations.
- Support concurrent access control and thread safety throughout the entire queue system.
- Implement efficient memory management for large-scale operations.
- Ensure compliance with ethical data handling practices and terms of service.
- Optimize performance for real-time operations and minimize latency.
- Support historical data tracking and analysis of queue operations.
- Implement proper scoping and cleanup of temporary resources.
- Provide tools for testing and mocking queue behaviors.
- Enable easy configuration and customization of queue parameters.
- Support integration with other Python libraries and frameworks commonly used in distributed systems.

# Notes

- Automatic Resource Management: Contextlib managers ensure that resources are properly allocated and released, reducing the risk of resource leaks in a multithreaded environment.
- Error Handling: They provide a structured approach to exception handling, allowing for more graceful error recovery in a distributed system.
- Code Readability: By encapsulating setup and teardown logic, contextlib managers contribute to more readable and maintainable code, especially when working with complex systems like task queues.
- Flexibility: They offer reusable patterns for common programming tasks, promoting code reuse and consistency across different components of the queue system.
- Integration with Built-in Functions: Many built-in Python functions (like socket) are already context managers, making integration seamless for networking operations related to task submission or retrieval.
- Customization: Developers can create custom context managers to solve domain-specific problems, improving code organization and reusability in the distributed computing domain.
- Thread Safety: Context managers can be used to implement thread-safe operations, ensuring that shared resources are accessed correctly in a multithreaded environment.
- The @contextmanager decorator allows creating generator-based context managers without defining separate **enter**() and **exit**() methods, useful for managing complex state machines in the queue system.
- The closing() function provides a convenient way to automatically close objects that support the context manager protocol, such as file handles or network connections.
- The suppress() function helps suppress specific exceptions within a context manager, which can be useful for handling transient errors during queue operations.

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

#### **Best Practices:**

- Keep context managers focused: Each context manager should handle a single responsibility, such as managing a specific resource or operation.
- Use contextlib.contextmanager for simple cases: It simplifies the creation of context managers, especially for complex operations like thread synchronization.
- Always ensure cleanup: The **exit** method should handle all cleanup, even in error cases, to prevent resource leaks in a multithreaded environment.
- Be careful with return values: The **exit** method's return value determines exception propagation, which is crucial for proper error handling in a distributed system.
- Use type hints: They improve code readability and catch potential errors early, especially when working with complex data structures like task queues.
- Document clearly: Explain what the context manager does, especially any side effects, to aid in understanding and maintenance of the queue system.

#### **Common Pitfalls:**

- Forgetting to release resources: Always release resources in the **exit** method to prevent resource leaks, especially in a multithreaded environment.
- Ignoring exceptions: Be cautious about silently catching exceptions in **exit**, as this might mask important errors in the queue logic.
- Performing too much in **enter**: Keep **enter** focused on setup to avoid exceptions before the context is fully entered, which could lead to initialization failures.
- Not considering thread safety: If the context manager might be used in multithreaded environments, ensure it's thread-safe to prevent race conditions and data corruption.
- Overuse of context managers: While powerful, they're not always necessary for simple operations. Balance their use with simpler alternatives when appropriate.
