# Problem Description

In this challenge, we'll focus on implementing asynchronous context managers in Python. Asynchronous context managers combine the benefits of async/await syntax with the resource management capabilities of contextlib.contextmanager.

Your task is to demonstrate deep understanding of asyncio concepts and their practical applications in the context of asynchronous context managers. Pay close attention to coroutine scheduling, task management, and efficient resource utilization in asynchronous environments.

# Versions

## Version 1: Basic Async Context Manager

Your task is to implement a simple asynchronous context manager that manages a database connection pool. Include:

- Creating a coroutine that establishes a database connection
- Implementing a context manager that yields the connection coroutine
- Handling exceptions during connection establishment and cleanup
- Demonstrating proper resource acquisition and release

## Version 2: Async Context Manager with Timeout

Expand upon the basic implementation by adding timeout support to your asynchronous context manager. Include:

- Implementing a mechanism to limit the duration of database connection acquisition
- Handling timeouts gracefully, possibly retrying connection attempts
- Demonstrating how timeouts affect resource acquisition in asynchronous contexts

## Version 3: Async Context Manager with Connection Pooling

Your task is to refactor the previous implementations to use a connection pool. Include:

- Implementing a connection pool manager using asyncio.Queue
- Managing a fixed number of connections in the pool
- Handling connection reuse and recycling
- Demonstrating efficient resource utilization in high-concurrency scenarios

## Version 4: Async Context Manager with Error Handling and Logging

Enhance your asynchronous context manager by implementing robust error handling and logging. Include:

- Implementing comprehensive exception handling for various database-related errors
- Creating a logging system to track connection lifecycle events and errors
- Demonstrating how to use asyncio.create_task() for concurrent operations
- Showing how to use asyncio.gather() for executing multiple coroutines simultaneously

# Constraints

- Ensure proper integration with Python's asyncio module and its standard library components.
- Implement efficient scheduling and execution of coroutines within the context manager.
- Provide clear documentation on the purpose and usage of each component.
- Handle potential exceptions and edge cases in asynchronous operations.
- Optimize performance for I/O-bound operations and minimize latency.
- Support integration with popular Python libraries for database operations (e.g., aioredis, asyncpg).
- Implement proper scoping and cleanup of resources in asynchronous contexts.
- Provide tools for testing and mocking asynchronous behaviors.
- Enable easy configuration and customization of asynchronous parameters.
- Support integration with frameworks like FastAPI or Starlette for building production-ready async applications.

# Notes

- Coroutine Syntax: Leverage Python's await and async keywords to create clean and readable asynchronous code within the context manager.
- Task Management: Utilize asyncio.create_task() for efficient concurrent execution of coroutines within the context manager.
- Exception Handling: Implement proper exception handling in asynchronous code, considering the unique characteristics of coroutine execution.
- Performance Optimization: Leverage asyncio's built-in optimizations for I/O-bound operations and minimize unnecessary context switching.
- Concurrency Control: Implement mechanisms to control concurrency in asynchronous applications, such as limiting parallel executions or managing worker pools.

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

#### **Best Practices:**

- Use async/await syntax consistently throughout your code for readability and maintainability.
- Prefer asyncio.create_task() over threading.Thread for CPU-bound tasks to avoid the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).
- Implement proper error handling and logging in asynchronous code to aid in debugging and maintenance.
- Use asyncio.run() for running top-level coroutines, avoiding the need for manual loop creation.
- Leverage asyncio.gather() for concurrent execution of multiple coroutines within the context manager.
- Use asyncio.TimeoutError for implementing timeout-based operations in asynchronous code.
- Document the purpose and behavior of each asynchronous component clearly.

#### **Common Pitfalls:**

- Mixing synchronous and asynchronous code without proper synchronization, leading to deadlocks or race conditions.
- Overusing asyncio.gather() for too many concurrent operations, potentially overwhelming the event loop.
- Ignoring the difference between blocking and non-blocking operations in asynchronous contexts.
- Not properly closing resources in asynchronous cleanup procedures.
- Misunderstanding the concept of "blocking" in asynchronous programming, particularly regarding I/O operations.
- Overcomplicating asynchronous code with nested callbacks, when simpler solutions exist using async/await.
- Failing to handle edge cases like connection timeouts or network failures in asynchronous operations.
