## Problem Description

Method overriding is a key feature of polymorphism in object-oriented programming. It allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. This problem set explores various aspects and applications of method overriding, challenging you to design and implement class hierarchies that effectively utilize this concept to create flexible and extensible software systems.

## Versions

### Version 1: Basic Method Overriding

Create a base class `Animal` with a method `makeSound()`. Then, create derived classes for specific animals (e.g., `Dog`, `Cat`, `Cow`) that override the `makeSound()` method to produce animal-specific sounds.

Questions to consider:

1. How do you ensure that all derived classes properly override the `makeSound()` method?
2. What happens if a derived class doesn't override the method? How would you handle this?
3. How can you use the `@Override` annotation (or its equivalent in your programming language) to catch errors at compile-time?

### Version 2: Method Overriding with Parameters

Expand the animal system to include a `move(distance)` method in the base `Animal` class. Override this method in derived classes to implement animal-specific movement behavior.

Questions to consider:

1. Can you change the parameter list when overriding a method? If so, under what circumstances?
2. How do you handle situations where a derived class needs additional parameters for its movement behavior?
3. What are the implications of changing the return type when overriding a method?

### Version 3: Access Modifiers and Method Overriding

Create a class hierarchy for a logging system with a base `Logger` class and derived classes like `FileLogger` and `DatabaseLogger`. The base class should have a protected `log(message)` method that derived classes override.

Questions to consider:

1. Can you change the access modifier of an overridden method? If so, what are the rules?
2. How do you handle situations where you want to prevent further overriding of a method in subclasses?
3. What are the implications of using the `final` keyword (or its equivalent) with method overriding?

### Version 4: Method Overriding and Polymorphism

Design a class hierarchy for a drawing application with a base `Shape` class and derived classes for different shapes (e.g., `Circle`, `Rectangle`, `Triangle`). Implement a `draw()` method that behaves differently for each shape.

Questions to consider:

1. How can you use method overriding to achieve polymorphic behavior?
2. What is the role of virtual methods (or their equivalent) in method overriding and polymorphism?
3. How would you implement a system where you can add new shapes without modifying existing code?

### Version 5: Real-Life Domain Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: GUI Framework

Design a class hierarchy for a GUI framework with a base `UIComponent` class and derived classes for different UI elements (e.g., `Button`, `TextField`, `Checkbox`). Implement methods like `render()` and `handleClick()` that are overridden in each derived class.

Questions to consider:

1. How would you handle common behavior in the base class while allowing for customization in derived classes?
2. How can you use method overriding to implement different visual styles for UI components?
3. What challenges might you face when trying to create composite UI components using this inheritance structure?

#### Scenario 2: Game Character System

Create a class hierarchy for a game character system with a base `Character` class and derived classes for different character types (e.g., `Warrior`, `Mage`, `Archer`). Implement methods like `attack()`, `defend()`, and `useSpecialAbility()` that are overridden in each derived class.

Questions to consider:

1. How would you implement an `attack()` method that considers character-specific attributes and weapons?
2. How can you use method overriding to create unique special abilities for each character type?
3. What challenges might you face when trying to implement a character progression system that allows characters to gain abilities from multiple classes?

#### Scenario 3: Financial Transaction System

Design a class hierarchy for a financial transaction system with a base `Transaction` class and derived classes for different transaction types (e.g., `Deposit`, `Withdrawal`, `Transfer`). Implement methods like `execute()` and `validateTransaction()` that are overridden in each derived class.

Questions to consider:

1. How would you implement a `validateTransaction()` method that performs both common and transaction-specific validations?
2. How can you use method overriding to handle different fee structures for various transaction types?
3. What challenges might you face when trying to implement multi-step transactions that involve multiple transaction types?

#### Scenario 4: Content Management System

Create a class hierarchy for a content management system with a base `Content` class and derived classes for different content types (e.g., `Article`, `Video`, `Podcast`). Implement methods like `publish()`, `archive()`, and `generateMetadata()` that are overridden in each derived class.

Questions to consider:

1. How would you implement a `publish()` method that handles both common and content-specific publishing steps?
2. How can you use method overriding to create custom metadata generation for each content type?
3. What challenges might you face when trying to implement a content versioning system that works across all content types?

#### Scenario 5: Vehicle Control System

Design a class hierarchy for a vehicle control system with a base `Vehicle` class and derived classes for different vehicle types (e.g., `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Truck`). Implement methods like `accelerate()`, `brake()`, and `turn()` that are overridden in each derived class.

Questions to consider:

1. How would you implement an `accelerate()` method that considers vehicle-specific characteristics like weight and engine power?
2. How can you use method overriding to handle different steering mechanisms for various vehicle types?
3. What challenges might you face when trying to implement an autonomous driving feature that works across all vehicle types?

## Constraints

- Ensure that overridden methods adhere to the contract defined by the base class method.
- Consider the impact of method overriding on code readability and maintainability.
- Be mindful of the potential for unexpected behavior when using method overriding in complex class hierarchies.

## Notes

- Method overriding is a powerful tool for customizing behavior in derived classes, but it should be used judiciously to avoid creating overly complex or tightly coupled class hierarchies.
- Consider using the Template Method pattern in conjunction with method overriding to create flexible and extensible designs.
- Be aware of the performance implications of virtual method calls (or their equivalent) when using method overriding extensively.
- Think about how you might use abstract methods or interfaces to enforce the implementation of certain methods in derived classes.
- Consider the benefits and drawbacks of using method overriding compared to other techniques like composition or strategy pattern for achieving polymorphic behavior.
