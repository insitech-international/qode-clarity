# Problem Description

Design and implement systems that effectively utilize both instance and class variables to model complex scenarios. The goal is to create efficient, scalable, and maintainable code that accurately represents shared and individual states of objects.

# Versions

## Version 1: Massively Multiplayer Online Game (MMOG) Economy System

Design a class-based system for managing the economy of an MMOG with the following requirements:

1. Create a `Currency` class with:
   - Class variables: exchange_rates, total_currency_in_circulation
   - Instance variables: amount, owner
   - Methods: transfer(), convert_to(), inflate(), deflate()

2. Implement a `Player` class with:
   - Class variables: total_players, player_wealth_distribution
   - Instance variables: id, name, inventory, bank_balance
   - Methods: earn(), spend(), trade(), calculate_net_worth()

3. Design an `Item` class with:
   - Class variables: item_registry, global_drop_rates
   - Instance variables: id, name, value, rarity
   - Methods: use(), upgrade(), salvage()

4. Create a `Market` class to handle player-to-player transactions:
   - Class variables: transaction_history, current_listings
   - Instance variables: commission_rate, allowed_currencies
   - Methods: list_item(), purchase_item(), cancel_listing()

5. Implement an `EconomyManager` class to oversee the entire game economy:
   - Class variables: economic_indicators, intervention_thresholds
   - Methods: adjust_drop_rates(), introduce_money_sinks(), generate_economic_report()

How would you use class and instance variables to model both server-wide economic states and individual player economies? How would you handle synchronization and consistency issues in a distributed game server environment?

## Version 2: Banking System with Multiple Branches

Create a class-based system for a multi-branch banking network with these specifications:

1. Design a `BankAccount` class with:
   - Class variables: total_accounts, interest_rates
   -## Version 2: Banking System with Multiple Branches (Continued)

1. Design a `BankAccount` class with:
   - Class variables: total_accounts, interest_rates
   - Instance variables: account_number, balance, owner, account_type
   - Methods: deposit(), withdraw(), transfer(), apply_interest()

2. Implement a `Customer` class with:
   - Class variables: customer_count, customer_segmentation_criteria
   - Instance variables: id, name, contact_info, credit_score
   - Methods: open_account(), close_account(), update_credit_score()

3. Create a `Branch` class to represent individual bank branches:
   - Class variables: total_branches, branch_performance_metrics
   - Instance variables: branch_id, location, staff, available_services
   - Methods: process_transaction(), generate_branch_report()

4. Design a `Loan` class for managing various types of loans:
   - Class variables: current_prime_rate, loan_approval_criteria
   - Instance variables: loan_id, borrower, principal, interest_rate, term
   - Methods: calculate_monthly_payment(), apply_for_loan(), foreclose()

5. Implement a `BankingSystem` class to oversee the entire banking network:
   - Class variables: regulatory_compliance_rules, system_wide_alerts
   - Methods: audit_branches(), update_interest_rates(), generate_financial_reports()

How would you use class and instance variables to manage both system-wide banking policies and individual account details? How would you handle real-time updates to shared data (like interest rates) across all instances?

## Version 3: Factory Production Line Simulation

Design a class-based system for simulating a factory production line with the following criteria:

1. Create a `Machine` class with:
   - Class variables: total_machines, machine_types, global_efficiency_factor
   - Instance variables: machine_id, current_status, production_rate, maintenance_schedule
   - Methods: start_production(), stop_production(), perform_maintenance()

2. Implement a `Product` class to represent items being manufactured:
   - Class variables: product_catalog, quality_standards
   - Instance variables: product_id, name, components, production_stage
   - Methods: advance_stage(), quality_check(), package()

3. Design a `Worker` class for factory employees:
   - Class variables: total_workers, shift_schedules, skill_matrix
   - Instance variables: employee_id, name, skills, current_station
   - Methods: clock_in(), clock_out(), operate_machine(), report_issue()

4. Create a `ProductionLine` class to manage the manufacturing process:
   - Class variables: line_configurations, production_targets
   - Instance variables: line_id, active_machines, current_products, efficiency_rating
   - Methods: start_line(), stop_line(), reconfigure(), calculate_output()

5. Implement a `FactorySimulator` class to oversee the entire simulation:
   - Class variables: simulation_parameters, global_market_demand
   - Methods: run_simulation(), generate_reports(), adjust_production_rates()

How would you use class and instance variables to model both factory-wide settings and individual machine or worker states? How would you handle the dynamic nature of a production line, where machines and workers may be added or removed?

# Real-Life Scenarios

1. **Social Media Platform User Interaction System**
   Design a class-based system for a social media platform that models user interactions, content creation, and trend analysis. Consider how to use class and instance variables to handle both platform-wide metrics and individual user data.

2. **Smart City Traffic Management System**
   Create a simulation of a smart city's traffic management system, using class and instance variables to model both city-wide traffic patterns and individual vehicle behaviors. Include classes for traffic lights, vehicles, pedestrians, and a central control system.

3. **University Course Management System**
   Develop a class structure for managing university courses, students, and faculty. Use class and instance variables to handle both university-wide policies and individual course or student data. Consider scenarios like course registration, grade calculation, and academic performance tracking.

4. **Stock Market Simulation**
   Design a class-based stock market simulation system. Use class variables to represent market-wide indicators and instance variables for individual stocks and trader portfolios. Include mechanisms for trading, market analysis, and regulatory oversight.

5. **Ecosystem Simulation**
   Create a class hierarchy to simulate a complex ecosystem. Use class variables to represent environmental factors affecting all organisms and instance variables for individual organism states. Model various species, their interactions, and environmental changes over time.

For each scenario, consider:
- How would you balance the use of class and instance variables to efficiently represent shared and individual states?
- What strategies would you employ to ensure thread-safety when multiple threads or processes might access class variables?
- How would you handle the potential memory implications of using class variables in systems with a large number of instances?
- What design patterns could be applied to manage complex interactions between class and instance variables?
- How would you approach testing systems with interdependent class and instance variables?

# Constraints

- Ensure proper encapsulation of both class and instance variables.
- Consider the implications of mutability for class variables and how to manage state changes safely.
- Design for scalability, considering how your use of class variables might affect system performance as the number of instances grows.
- Be mindful of the potential for tight coupling when using class variables and design to minimize negative impacts on modularity.
- Consider how to handle initialization and cleanup of class variables in languages that don't provide explicit support for class constructors or destructors.

# Notes

- Reflect on the appropriate use cases for class variables versus other mechanisms like singletons or global state managers.
- Consider the impact of class variables on object-oriented principles like encapsulation and the potential for creating hidden dependencies.
- Think about how the use of class variables affects the ability to create isolated unit tests for individual instances.
- Explore how different programming languages handle class variables and static members, and how this might influence your design decisions.
