# Problem Description

Design and implement a system using class definitions to model complex real-world entities and their interactions. The goal is to create well-structured, maintainable, and extensible code that accurately represents the problem domain.

# Versions

## Version 1: Multiplayer Online Game Character System

Design a class-based system for a multiplayer online game with the following requirements:

1. Create a base `Character` class with:

   - Attributes: name, level, health, mana, experience, inventory
   - Methods: level_up(), take_damage(), heal(), use_ability(), add_to_inventory(), remove_from_inventory()

2. Design the following subclasses, each with unique attributes and methods:

   - `Warrior`: Additional attributes like rage, armor; methods like charge(), shield_block()
   - `Mage`: Additional attributes like spell_power, mana_regeneration; methods like cast_spell(), teleport()
   - `Rogue`: Additional attributes like energy, stealth; methods like backstab(), vanish()
   - `Priest`: Additional attributes like faith, holy_power; methods like heal_ally(), smite()

3. Implement an `Item` class to represent various game items, with subclasses for different item types (e.g., `Weapon`, `Armor`, `Consumable`).

4. Create a `Party` class that can group multiple `Character` instances together, with methods for party management and shared actions.

5. Design a `Quest` class that characters or parties can undertake, with objectives, rewards, and completion criteria.

How would you structure these classes to allow for easy addition of new character types, items, and quests while maintaining game balance and performance?

## Version 2: E-commerce Platform Product Management System

Create a class-based system for managing products in an e-commerce platform with these specifications:

1. Design a base `Product` class with:

   - Attributes: id, name, description, price, stock_quantity, category
   - Methods: update_price(), restock(), apply_discount(), get_tax()

2. Implement the following subclasses, each with specific attributes and methods:

   - `PhysicalProduct`: Additional attributes like weight, dimensions; methods like calculate_shipping_cost()
   - `DigitalProduct`: Additional attributes like file_size, download_link; methods like generate_license_key()
   - `SubscriptionProduct`: Additional attributes like billing_cycle, features; methods like renew(), cancel()
   - `BundleProduct`: Can contain multiple other products; methods like add_product(), remove_product()

3. Create a `Category` class to represent product categories, allowing for hierarchical category structures.

4. Implement a `Inventory` class to manage stock levels, with methods for stock updates, low stock alerts, and inventory valuation.

5. Design a `Promotion` class that can be applied to products or categories, with various types of discounts and validity periods.

How would you design this system to handle complex product relationships, dynamic pricing, and efficient inventory management at scale?

## Version 3: Content Management System (CMS)

Design an extensible class-based system for a CMS with the following criteria:

1. Create a base `Content` class with:

   - Attributes: id, title, body, author, created_date, last_modified_date, status
   - Methods: publish(), unpublish(), archive(), restore(), update()

2. Implement the following content type subclasses:

   - `Article`: Additional attributes like excerpt, featured_image; methods like add_tag(), remove_tag()
   - `Page`: Additional attributes like parent_page, order; methods like set_as_homepage(), add_to_menu()
   - `MediaItem`: Additional attributes like file_type, file_size; methods like generate_thumbnail(), update_metadata()
   - `CustomForm`: Ability to add custom fields; methods like submit(), export_responses()

3. Design a `User` class with roles and permissions, and integrate it with the content classes for authorship and access control.

4. Create a `Workflow` class to manage content approval processes, with states like draft, review, approved, and published.

5. Implement a `Version` class to handle content versioning and rollbacks.

How would you structure this system to allow for easy addition of new content types, flexible workflows, and efficient content retrieval and rendering?

# Real-Life Scenarios

1. **Smart Home Automation System**
   Design a class-based system for a smart home automation platform that can integrate various types of smart devices, manage device states, handle user interactions, and implement automation rules.

2. **Financial Portfolio Management System**
   Create a class hierarchy for a financial portfolio management system that can handle various types of assets, perform risk analysis, generate reports, and simulate investment strategies.

3. **Healthcare Management System**
   Develop a class-based architecture for a healthcare management system that can handle patient records, medical staff scheduling, inventory management, and billing processes.

4. **Virtual Reality Education Platform**
   Design a class system for a VR education platform that can represent various learning environments, interactive objects, user avatars, and educational content types.

5. **Logistics and Supply Chain Management System**
   Create a class-based system for managing complex logistics and supply chain operations, including inventory tracking, route optimization, order processing, and supplier management.

For each scenario, consider:

- How would you design the class hierarchy to accurately model the domain entities and their relationships?
- What design patterns could be applied to improve the flexibility and maintainability of the system?
- How would you handle complex business logic and ensure it's appropriately distributed among the classes?
- What strategies would you employ to ensure the system remains performant as it scales?
- How would you design the classes to facilitate easy serialization and deserialization for data persistence?

# Constraints

- Classes should follow the Single Responsibility Principle.
- Consider using abstract classes where appropriate to define common behavior.
- Design for extensibility, allowing for easy addition of new subclasses or features.
- Implement proper encapsulation, using access modifiers to control visibility of class members.
- Consider memory usage and performance implications of your class designs, especially for systems expected to handle large amounts of data or high concurrency.

# Notes

- Focus on creating a robust and flexible architecture rather than implementation details.
- Consider how to balance between inheritance and composition in your class designs.
- Think about how to handle cross-cutting concerns that affect multiple classes (e.g., logging, validation).
- Reflect on how your class designs facilitate or hinder unit testing and dependency injection.
