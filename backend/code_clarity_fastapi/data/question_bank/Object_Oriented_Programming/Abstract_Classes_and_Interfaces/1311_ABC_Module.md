## Problem Description
Demonstrate your understanding and application of Python's ABC (Abstract Base Classes) module by solving the following problems:
1. Design an enterprise-level logging system using ABC. Create an abstract base class `Logger` with abstract methods `log_info()`, `log_warning()`, `log_error()`, and `log_critical()`. Implement concrete classes for `FileLogger`, `DatabaseLogger`, and `CloudLogger`. Include a method `rotate_logs()` in the abstract base class with a default implementation that can be overridden.
2. Develop a game engine component system using ABC. Create an abstract base class `GameComponent` with abstract methods `update()`, `render()`, and `handle_event(event)`. Implement concrete classes for `PlayerComponent`, `EnemyComponent`, and `EnvironmentComponent`. Add a concrete method `is_active()` in the abstract base class.
3. Implement a robotics control system using ABC. Design an abstract base class `RobotController` with abstract methods `move_forward()`, `turn()`, `grab_object()`, and `release_object()`. Create concrete classes for different robot types like `HumanoidRobot`, `DroneRobot`, and `ArmRobot`. Include an abstract property `battery_level` and a concrete method `check_safety()` in the abstract base class.
4. Create a financial instrument modeling system using ABC. Design an abstract base class `FinancialInstrument` with abstract methods `calculate_value()`, `calculate_risk()`, and `generate_report()`. Implement concrete classes for `Stock`, `Bond`, and `Derivative`. Add an abstract property `market_data` and a concrete method `update_market_data()` in the abstract base class.
5. Develop a machine learning model evaluation framework using ABC. Create an abstract base class `MLModel` with abstract methods `train()`, `predict()`, and `evaluate()`. Implement concrete classes for `RandomForest`, `NeuralNetwork`, and `SVM`. Include abstract properties `hyperparameters` and `feature_importance`, and a concrete method `cross_validate()` in the abstract base class.
## Constraints
- Use the `abc` module to create abstract base classes.
- Properly use the `@abstractmethod` decorator for abstract methods.
- Ensure all abstract methods are implemented in concrete classes.
- Use type hints for method parameters and return values.
- Implement at least one concrete method and one abstract property in each abstract base class.
## Notes
- Consider using `ABC` as the base class for your abstract classes.
- Remember that abstract properties can be created using the `@property` decorator in combination with `@abstractmethod`.
- Abstract base classes can include both abstract and concrete methods.
- Python's ABC module allows for runtime checking of the abstract interface implementation.
- Think about how abstract base classes can enforce a common interface across different implementations in a complex system.
