# Problem Description

Design and implement a system using Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) to create a flexible and extensible architecture for various real-world scenarios. The goal is to define common interfaces and behaviors while allowing for specialized implementations in subclasses.

# Versions

## Version 1: Game Character System

Design an ABC hierarchy for a complex game character system with the following requirements:

1. Create a base `Character` ABC with:
   - Abstract methods: `move()`, `attack()`, `defend()`, `use_special_ability()`
   - Abstract properties: `health`, `mana`, `speed`, `strength`
   - Concrete method: `level_up()` that increases all stats by 10%

2. Design the following subclasses, each with unique implementations of the abstract methods and properties:
   - `Warrior`: Focuses on strength and defense
   - `Mage`: Emphasizes mana usage and ranged attacks
   - `Rogue`: Prioritizes speed and stealth
   - `Healer`: Specializes in support abilities and mana management

3. Implement a `CombatSystem` class that can work with any `Character` subclass, demonstrating polymorphism.

4. Add an abstract class method `create_character(character_type: str) -> Character` that acts as a factory method for creating character instances.

5. Implement a mixin class `Mountable` that can be applied to any character, adding `mount()` and `dismount()` methods.

How would you structure this system to maximize flexibility and extensibility?

## Version 2: IoT Device Management System

Create an ABC-based system for managing various IoT devices with these specifications:

1. Design a base `IoTDevice` ABC with:
   - Abstract methods: `connect()`, `disconnect()`, `send_data()`, `receive_data()`, `update_firmware()`
   - Abstract properties: `device_id`, `connection_status`, `battery_level`, `firmware_version`
   - Concrete method: `ping()` that returns the device's current status

2. Implement the following subclasses, each with unique attributes and behaviors:
   - `SmartThermostat`: Manages temperature settings and energy usage
   - `SecurityCamera`: Handles video streaming and motion detection
   - `SmartLock`: Controls access and maintains an access log
   - `EnvironmentalSensor`: Monitors air quality, humidity, and temperature

3. Create an `IoTHub` class that can manage multiple `IoTDevice` instances, regardless of their specific type.

4. Implement an abstract `diagnostic_check()` method that each subclass must define to perform device-specific health checks.

5. Design a `RemoteAccessible` mixin that adds remote control capabilities to compatible devices.

How would you structure this system to ensure easy addition of new device types and management features?

## Version 3: E-commerce Payment Gateway System

Design an extensible payment gateway system using ABCs with the following criteria:

1. Create a base `PaymentGateway` ABC with:
   - Abstract methods: `process_payment()`, `refund()`, `verify_transaction()`, `generate_receipt()`
   - Abstract properties: `gateway_name`, `supported_currencies`, `transaction_fee_percentage`
   - Concrete method: `calculate_fee(amount: float) -> float`

2. Implement the following subclasses, each representing a different payment gateway:
   - `CreditCardGateway`: Handles various credit card types
   - `PayPalGateway`: Manages PayPal-specific transactions
   - `CryptocurrencyGateway`: Supports multiple cryptocurrencies
   - `BankTransferGateway`: Handles direct bank transfers

3. Design a `Transaction` class that works with any `PaymentGateway` subclass to process payments.

4. Implement an abstract class method `get_supported_payment_methods() -> List[str]` that each subclass must define to return its supported payment methods.

5. Create a `FraudDetection` mixin that can be applied to any gateway, adding advanced fraud checking capabilities.

How would you design this system to allow for easy integration of new payment gateways and ensure consistency across different payment methods?

# Real-Life Scenarios

1. **Multimedia Streaming Platform**
   Design an ABC-based system for a multimedia streaming platform that supports various types of content (e.g., videos, music, podcasts, live streams). Consider features like content delivery, user interactions, monetization, and analytics.

2. **Automated Trading System**
   Create an ABC hierarchy for an automated trading system that can work with different financial instruments, implement various trading strategies, and interact with multiple exchanges. Include considerations for risk management and performance analysis.

3. **Smart City Management System**
   Develop an ABC-based architecture for a smart city management system that integrates various subsystems such as traffic management, waste management, energy distribution, and emergency services. Focus on interoperability and scalability.

4. **Machine Learning Model Management**
   Design an ABC system for managing and deploying machine learning models in a production environment. Consider aspects like model versioning, A/B testing, feature engineering, and model performance monitoring.

5. **Robotic Process Automation (RPA) Framework**
   Create an ABC-based framework for building RPA bots that can automate various business processes across different applications and platforms. Include considerations for task scheduling, error handling, and reporting.

For each scenario, consider:
- How would you structure the ABC hierarchy to maximize code reuse and minimize redundancy?
- What abstract methods and properties would you define in the base classes?
- How would you handle scenario-specific requirements while maintaining a generic interface?
- What mechanisms would you implement to ensure the system remains extensible for future additions?
- How would you design the system to facilitate unit testing and mocking of components?

# Constraints

- Ensure that the ABC cannot be instantiated directly.
- All abstract methods and properties must be implemented in concrete subclasses.
- The system should be designed to allow for easy addition of new subclasses without modifying existing code (Open-Closed Principle).
- Consider using multiple inheritance or mixins where appropriate, but be mindful of potential complications.
- The design should facilitate unit testing and mocking of individual components.

# Notes

- Focus on creating a robust and flexible architecture rather than implementation details.
- Consider edge cases and potential future extensions when designing the ABC hierarchy.
- Think about how to balance between generic interfaces and specialized behaviors.
- Reflect on how the use of ABCs can improve code organization, maintainability, and scalability in large systems.
