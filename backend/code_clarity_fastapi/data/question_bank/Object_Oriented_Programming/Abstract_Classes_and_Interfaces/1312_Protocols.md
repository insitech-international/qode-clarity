## Metadata
- **ID**: OOP-001-B

- **Subcategory**: Abstract Classes and Interfaces
- **Real Life Domains**: Microservices Architecture, Data Processing Pipelines, Plugin Systems
## Problem Description
Demonstrate your understanding and application of Python's Protocol concept (introduced in Python 3.8) by solving the following problems:
1. Design a microservices architecture using protocols. Define a `Microservice` protocol with methods `health_check()`, `process_request(data: Dict)`, and `get_metrics() -> Dict`. Implement concrete microservices like `AuthenticationService`, `DataProcessingService`, and `NotificationService` that adhere to this protocol.
2. Create a data processing pipeline using protocols. Define protocols for `DataSource`, `DataTransformer`, and `DataSink` with appropriate methods. Implement various classes (e.g., `CSVDataSource`, `JSONDataSink`, `EncryptionTransformer`) that follow these protocols. Design a `Pipeline` class that can work with any combination of objects adhering to these protocols.
3. Implement a plugin system for a text editor application. Define a `Plugin` protocol with methods `activate()`, `deactivate()`, and `execute_action(context: Dict)`. Create various plugins (e.g., `SpellChecker`, `CodeFormatter`, `AutoSave`) that adhere to this protocol. Develop a `PluginManager` class that can dynamically load and manage plugins.
4. Design a financial modeling system using protocols. Define protocols for `FinancialInstrument`, `RiskModel`, and `PricingEngine` with appropriate methods. Implement various classes (e.g., `Stock`, `Bond`, `OptionPricingEngine`, `MonteCarloRiskModel`) that follow these protocols. Create a `PortfolioAnalyzer` class that can work with any combination of these protocol-adherent objects.
5. Develop a machine learning experiment framework using protocols. Define protocols for `DataLoader`, `Model`, `Optimizer`, and `Evaluator`. Implement various classes adhering to these protocols for different ML tasks. Create an `ExperimentRunner` class that can execute experiments with any combination of protocol-compliant components.
## Constraints
- Use Python 3.8+ features for implementing protocols.
- Do not use inheritance for implementing the protocols; rely on structural subtyping.
- Use type hints throughout your code, including for protocol definitions.
- Ensure that classes adhering to protocols implement all required methods.
- Consider using `@runtime_checkable` decorator for protocols that should support instance and class checks.
## Notes
- Protocols are defined in the `typing` module in Python 3.8+.
- Unlike ABC, protocols don't require explicit inheritance to be implemented.
- Remember that protocols support method, attribute, and property definitions.
- Protocols can be used with static type checkers like mypy for enhanced type checking.
- Consider how protocols can enhance flexibility and maintainability in large-scale systems.
