# Problem Description

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides a robust set of features for running and coordinating containers across a cluster of machines. The challenge is to understand the basic concepts of Kubernetes and deploy a Python application using Kubernetes manifests.

# Versions

**Real Life Scenarios**

## Version 1: Kubernetes Cluster Setup

Set up a basic Kubernetes cluster:

1. Install and configure a Kubernetes cluster using tools like Minikube or kubeadm.
2. Verify the cluster status and node readiness.
3. Deploy a sample application (e.g., Nginx) using a Kubernetes Deployment.
4. Expose the application using a Kubernetes Service.
5. Access the application from outside the cluster.

## Version 2: Application Deployment

Deploy a Python application on Kubernetes:

1. Containerize the Python application using Docker.
2. Create a Kubernetes Deployment manifest for the application.
3. Define the required resources (e.g., CPU, memory) and replicas.
4. Create a Kubernetes Service manifest to expose the application.
5. Apply the manifests to the Kubernetes cluster and verify the deployment.

## Version 3: Scaling and Rolling Updates

Implement scaling and rolling updates for the Python application:

1. Use Kubernetes HorizontalPodAutoscaler to automatically scale the application based on CPU usage.
2. Perform a rolling update of the application by updating the container image version.
3. Monitor the rolling update progress and rollback if necessary.
4. Configure readiness and liveness probes for the application pods.
5. Implement graceful shutdown and startup for the application containers.

## Version 4: Kubernetes Networking and Storage

Configure networking and storage for the Python application:

1. Create a Kubernetes Ingress resource to route external traffic to the application.
2. Configure SSL/TLS termination for the Ingress using Kubernetes Secrets.
3. Implement network policies to control traffic between pods and namespaces.
4. Use Kubernetes PersistentVolumes and PersistentVolumeClaims to provide persistent storage for the application.
5. Configure data replication and backup for the persistent storage.

# Constraints

1. Ensure compatibility with the latest version of Kubernetes and the chosen container runtime (e.g., Docker).
2. Use appropriate Kubernetes resource definitions and manifest files.
3. Ensure proper resource allocation and limits for the application pods.
4. Implement proper health checks and monitoring for the application.
5. Handle application configuration and secrets securely using Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets.
6. Ensure the application is scalable and can handle high traffic loads.
7. Implement proper access controls and role-based access control (RBAC) for the Kubernetes cluster.
8. Consider the network and storage requirements of the application.
9. Ensure the application is fault-tolerant and can recover from node failures.
10. Implement proper logging and monitoring for the Kubernetes cluster and application pods.

# Notes

- Use YAML or JSON format for writing Kubernetes manifest files.
- Use the `kubectl` command-line tool to interact with the Kubernetes cluster.
- Use Kubernetes Deployments to define the desired state of the application pods.
- Use Kubernetes Services to provide stable network endpoints for the application pods.
- Use Kubernetes Ingress to route external traffic to the application services.
- Use Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets to manage application configuration and sensitive data.
- Use Kubernetes PersistentVolumes and PersistentVolumeClaims for persistent storage.
- Use Kubernetes HorizontalPodAutoscaler for automatic scaling based on resource utilization.
- Use Kubernetes rolling updates and rollbacks for application updates and version management.
- Use Kubernetes network policies to control traffic between pods and namespaces.
- Use Kubernetes RBAC to define and enforce access controls for the cluster resources.
- Use Kubernetes monitoring and logging tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack) for observability.
- Use Kubernetes Helm charts for packaging and deploying complex applications.
- Regularly update Kubernetes and its components to address security vulnerabilities.
- Follow Kubernetes best practices for resource management, security, and scalability.
