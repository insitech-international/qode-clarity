# Problem Description

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It allows you to configure and manage multiple services, networks, and volumes using a single YAML file. The challenge is to create a Docker Compose configuration for a Python application, ensuring seamless orchestration and communication between containers.

# Versions

**Real Life Scenarios**

## Version 1: Basic Web Application

Create a Docker Compose configuration for a basic Python web application:

1. Define a `docker-compose.yml` file in the project root directory.
2. Configure a web service using a Python web framework (e.g., Flask, Django).
3. Specify the container image, build context, and necessary environment variables.
4. Map the container ports to the host machine ports.
5. Define a volume to persist application data.

## Version 2: Multi-Service Application

Extend the Docker Compose configuration to support multiple services:

1. Add additional services to the `docker-compose.yml` file, such as a database service (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
2. Configure the services to communicate with each other using service names as hostnames.
3. Define environment variables for service-specific configurations.
4. Set up a shared network for inter-service communication.
5. Specify volume mounts for data persistence and sharing between containers.

## Version 3: Development Environment

Create a Docker Compose configuration for a local development environment:

1. Define a `docker-compose.dev.yml` file for development-specific configurations.
2. Configure the services to mount the local source code as a volume for hot-reloading.
3. Set up a development-specific database service with sample data.
4. Expose additional ports for debugging and testing purposes.
5. Include development tools and utilities as separate services (e.g., pgAdmin, Adminer).

## Version 4: Scaling and Orchestration

Configure Docker Compose to support scaling and orchestration:

1. Use the `deploy` section in the `docker-compose.yml` file to specify scaling options.
2. Define replicas for services that need to be scaled horizontally.
3. Configure load balancing and service discovery using Docker Swarm or Kubernetes.
4. Implement rolling updates and rollbacks for zero-downtime deployments.
5. Define health checks and restart policies for service resilience.

# Constraints

1. Ensure compatibility with the latest version of Docker Compose and Docker Engine.
2. Use appropriate Docker images and base images for the application services.
3. Handle sensitive information, such as database credentials, using environment variables or secrets.
4. Optimize the Docker images to minimize the image size and build time.
5. Implement proper network isolation and security measures for inter-service communication.
6. Ensure the Docker Compose configuration is maintainable and can be easily extended or modified.
7. Follow best practices for Docker Compose file structure and service definitions.
8. Consider the resource limitations and scaling requirements of the application.
9. Implement proper logging and monitoring for the containerized services.
10. Ensure proper cleanup and teardown of resources when stopping or removing the application.

# Notes

- Use the `version` key to specify the Docker Compose file format version.
- Define services using the `services` key and provide a name for each service.
- Use the `build` key to specify the build context and Dockerfile for a service.
- Use the `image` key to specify a pre-built Docker image for a service.
- Use the `ports` key to map container ports to host ports.
- Use the `volumes` key to define and mount volumes for data persistence.
- Use the `environment` key to set environment variables for a service.
- Use the `depends_on` key to define service dependencies and startup order.
- Use the `networks` key to create and configure networks for inter-service communication.
- Use the `command` key to override the default command for a service.
- Use the `restart` key to specify the restart policy for a service.
- Use the `deploy` key to configure scaling, replicas, and orchestration options.
- Use the `healthcheck` key to define health check commands for a service.
- Use the `logging` key to configure logging options for a service.
- Use the `docker-compose up` command to start the application and its services.
- Use the `docker-compose down` command to stop and remove the application containers.
