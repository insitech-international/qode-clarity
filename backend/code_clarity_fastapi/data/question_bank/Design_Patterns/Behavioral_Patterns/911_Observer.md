# Problem Description

You are tasked with implementing a system that allows objects to be notified automatically of any state changes in other objects they are interested in, without tightly coupling the objects to each other. This pattern should be flexible enough to allow for dynamic registration and deregistration of interested objects (observers) and should support one-to-many relationships between the object being observed (subject) and the observers.

# Versions

## Version 1: Basic Observer Pattern

Implement a basic observer pattern where a subject maintains a list of observers and notifies them of any state changes.

## Version 2: Event-Driven Observer Pattern

Extend the basic observer pattern to support multiple types of events and allow observers to subscribe to specific event types.

## Version 3: Thread-Safe Observer Pattern

Implement a thread-safe version of the observer pattern that can handle concurrent modifications to the observer list and notifications.

## Version 4: Real life Scenarios

# Constraints

- The subject should not make assumptions about its observers beyond the observer interface.
- Observers should be added or removed from the subject dynamically at runtime.
- The order in which observers are notified should not be guaranteed.
- The implementation should avoid circular references that could lead to memory leaks.
- In multi-threaded environments, proper synchronization must be ensured to prevent race conditions.

# Notes

- Consider using weak references to observers to prevent memory leaks in long-running applications.
- Be mindful of the performance impact when notifying a large number of observers, especially if the update operation is costly.
- In GUI applications, ensure that observer updates don't block the main event loop.
- For distributed systems, consider using a message queue or pub/sub system to implement the observer pattern at scale.
- When implementing in statically-typed languages, consider using generics to provide type-safety for different types of events or data.
