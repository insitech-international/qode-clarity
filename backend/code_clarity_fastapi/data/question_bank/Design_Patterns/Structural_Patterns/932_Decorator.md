# Problem Description

You are tasked with adding new functionalities or behaviors to objects dynamically without altering their existing code. The challenge is to design a flexible system that allows functionalities to be added and combined in various ways, while keeping the core objects simple and focused on their primary responsibilities.

# Versions

## Version 1: Basic Decorator Pattern

Implement a simple decorator that adds a new behavior to an existing object.

Questions to consider:

- How would you ensure that the decorator can work with any subclass of the original object?
- What approach would you take to allow multiple decorators to be stacked on a single object?
- How would you handle scenarios where decorators need to modify the behavior of methods in the wrapped object?

## Version 2: Parameterized Decorators

Design decorators that can be configured with parameters to modify their behavior.

Questions to consider:

- How would you implement decorators that can accept configuration at runtime?
- What strategies can be used to manage and validate decorator parameters?
- How would you handle scenarios where decorator parameters might conflict with each other?

## Version 3: Stateful Decorators

Create decorators that maintain their own state in addition to modifying the behavior of the wrapped object.

Questions to consider:

- How would you manage the lifecycle of stateful decorators?
- What approaches can be used to ensure thread-safety in stateful decorators?
- How would you handle scenarios where the state of multiple decorators needs to be coordinated?

## Version 4: Aspect-Oriented Decorators

Implement decorators that add cross-cutting concerns (like logging, caching, or transaction management) to existing objects.

Questions to consider:

- How would you design decorators to minimize code duplication across different cross-cutting concerns?
- What strategies would you use to apply aspect-oriented decorators consistently across a large codebase?
- How would you handle scenarios where multiple aspect-oriented decorators need to be applied in a specific order?

## Version 5: Real-life Scenarios

1. **Customizable Reporting System**:
   Design a reporting system where users can dynamically add features like filters, sorting, grouping, and formatting to basic reports.

   Questions:

   - How would you implement decorators that can modify both the data processing and the output format of reports?

   - How would you design decorators to handle asynchronous operations in the middleware?
   - What strategies would you use to ensure that middleware decorators don't significantly impact response times?
   - How would you implement a system to dynamically enable or disable middleware components based on configuration or request parameters?

3. **Game Character Customization**:
   Implement a system for customizing game characters with various abilities, equipment, and visual enhancements using decorators.

   Questions:

   - How would you handle scenarios where certain character enhancements are mutually exclusive?
   - What approach would you take to manage the performance impact of multiple visual enhancement decorators in a real-time rendering environment?
   - How would you design the decorator system to support serialization for saving and loading custom characters?

4. **Configurable Data Processing Pipeline**:
   Design a data processing system where various transformations, validations, and enrichments can be dynamically added to a data pipeline.

   Questions:

   - How would you handle scenarios where the order of decorators significantly affects the outcome?
   - What strategies would you employ to optimize performance when dealing with large volumes of data and multiple decorators?
   - How would you design the system to allow for easy debugging and tracing of the data transformation process?
   - What approach would you take to handle errors or exceptions that occur within individual decorators without breaking the entire pipeline?

5. **Dynamic Permission System**:
   Create a flexible permission system for a content management platform where access rights can be combined and layered dynamically.

   Questions:

   - How would you design decorators to handle complex permission rules that depend on user roles, content type, and contextual factors?
   - What approach would you take to ensure that the permission system remains performant when checking access rights for large numbers of users and content items?
   - How would you implement an audit trail to track which decorators were responsible for granting or denying specific permissions?
   - What strategies would you use to manage potential conflicts between different permission decorators?

6. **Customizable IoT Device Behavior**:
   Develop a system for IoT devices where functionality can be added or modified dynamically through over-the-air updates using decorators.

   Questions:

   - How would you ensure that new decorators don't interfere with the core functionality or stability of the IoT devices?
   - What approach would you take to manage the limited resources (memory, processing power) on IoT devices when adding multiple decorators?
   - How would you design the system to allow for easy rollback of decorators if issues are detected after deployment?
   - What strategies would you employ to secure the decorator update process against potential attacks or unauthorized modifications?

7. **Adaptive Machine Learning Model**:
   Design a system where machine learning models can be dynamically enhanced with pre-processing steps, feature engineering, and post-processing using decorators.

   Questions:

   - How would you handle scenarios where certain decorators might significantly impact the model's performance or accuracy?
   - What approach would you take to allow data scientists to experiment with different combinations of decorators easily?
   - How would you design the system to track the impact of each decorator on the model's performance metrics?
   - What strategies would you use to ensure that the decorators can work with different types of machine learning models (e.g., classification, regression, clustering)?

8. **Flexible GUI Component Library**:
   Create a GUI component library where developers can dynamically add behaviors like resizing, theming, accessibility features, and event handling to base components.

   Questions:

   - How would you manage potential conflicts between decorators that modify the same aspects of a component (e.g., size, color)?
   - What approach would you take to ensure that decorators maintain consistent behavior across different platforms or rendering engines?
   - How would you design the system to allow for easy creation of composite components using multiple decorators?
   - What strategies would you employ to optimize rendering performance when multiple visual decorators are applied to a single component?

**Advanced Considerations**

1. **Performance Optimization**:
   In scenarios with deeply nested decorators or high-frequency operations, performance can become a concern.

   Questions:

   - How would you implement a caching mechanism for decorator chains to avoid redundant computations?
   - What strategies could be employed to lazily evaluate decorator effects only when necessary?
   - How might you use techniques like decorator fusion or compilation to optimize chains of decorators?

2. **Decorator Dependency Management**:
   In complex systems, decorators might have dependencies on each other or external services.

   - What approaches could be used to inject dependencies into decorators dynamically?
   - How would you handle scenarios where circular dependencies between decorators might occur?

3. **Aspect-Oriented Decorators**:
   Decorators can be used to implement cross-cutting concerns in a manner similar to aspect-oriented programming.

   Questions:

   - How would you design decorators to handle concerns like logging, error handling, or performance monitoring across a large system?
   - What strategies could be used to apply aspect-oriented decorators consistently across different parts of an application?
   - How might you implement pointcut-like functionality to specify where and when certain decorators should be applied?

4. **Reflection and Metaprogramming**:
   In some languages, reflection and metaprogramming can be used to create highly dynamic decorator systems.

   Questions:

   - How might you use reflection to create decorators that can adapt to changes in the decorated objects' interfaces?
   - What approaches could be used to generate decorators dynamically based on metadata or configuration?
   - How would you balance the flexibility of metaprogramming-based decorators with concerns about type safety and code readability?

These scenarios and questions aim to explore the Decorator pattern in the context of complex, real-world systems. They encourage thinking about scalability, maintainability, performance, and advanced software design principles when applying the Decorator pattern to solve sophisticated problems in various domains.

# Constraints

- Decorators should conform to the interface of the objects they decorate, allowing them to be used interchangeably.
- The core component classes should be kept as simple as possible, with additional functionality provided by decorators.
- Consider the performance implications of using multiple layers of decorators.
- Ensure that decorators can be combined in any order without breaking the system.
- Be mindful of the potential complexity introduced by excessive use of decorators.

# Notes

- Use the Decorator pattern when you need to be able to assign extra behaviors to objects at runtime without breaking the code that uses these objects.
- This pattern provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
- Be cautious of creating small decorator classes that don't justify the complexity they add to the code.
- In some languages, you might be able to use features like mixins or traits to achieve similar results with less complexity.
- Consider using the Factory or Builder patterns to manage the creation of decorated objects with multiple layers.
