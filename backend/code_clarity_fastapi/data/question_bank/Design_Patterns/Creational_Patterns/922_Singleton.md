# Problem Description

You are tasked with ensuring that a class has only one instance and providing a global point of access to that instance. This is particularly useful for coordinating actions across a system, managing shared resources, or maintaining a single state throughout the application's lifecycle. The challenge is to implement this in a way that is thread-safe, lazy-loaded when necessary, and prevents the creation of multiple instances through normal instantiation or serialization.

# Versions

## Version 1: Basic Singleton Pattern

Implement a basic singleton pattern with lazy initialization.

## Version 2: Thread-Safe Singleton with Lazy Initialization

Implement a thread-safe singleton pattern that uses lazy initialization.

## Version 3: Singleton with Global State Management

Implement a singleton that manages global state and provides methods to access and modify that state.

## Version 4: Multiton Pattern

Extend the Singleton concept to allow a controlled set of instances, each identified by a key. This is useful in scenarios where you need to manage a limited pool of resources, such as database connections for different schemas or configuration sets for different environments.

Questions to consider:
- How would you implement a thread-safe multiton?
- What strategies can be used to limit the total number of instances created?
- How would you handle cleanup of unused instances to prevent memory leaks?

## Version 5: Registry of Singletons

Implement a system where multiple singletons are managed by a central registry. This can be useful in complex systems where different components each require their own singleton instance, but there's a need for centralized management and access.

Questions to consider:
- How would you design the API for the registry to allow easy registration and retrieval of singletons?
- What mechanisms could be used to ensure that only one instance of each registered singleton exists?
- How would you handle dependencies between different singletons in the registry?

## Version 6: Testable Singleton

Design a singleton pattern that allows for easy unit testing, including the ability to reset the singleton state or replace it with a mock object for testing purposes.

Questions to consider:
- How can you modify the singleton pattern to allow state reset between test cases?
- What design changes are needed to allow dependency injection of a mock singleton in test environments?
- How would you handle scenarios where multiple threads might be accessing the singleton during tests?

## Version 7: Real-life Scenarios

1. **Database Connection Pool**:
   Implement a connection pool as a Singleton to manage a fixed number of database connections shared across the application.

   Questions:
   - How would you handle connection timeouts and reconnection attempts?
   - What strategy would you use to distribute connections fairly among different parts of the application?
   - How would you implement monitoring and logging for the connection pool?

2. **Application Configuration Manager**:
   Create a Singleton to manage application-wide configuration settings that can be updated at runtime.

   Questions:
   - How would you implement hot-reloading of configuration changes without restarting the application?
   - What strategies would you use to ensure thread-safe access to configuration values?
   - How would you handle environment-specific configurations in a multi-environment deployment scenario?

3. **Logging Service**:
   Design a centralized logging service as a Singleton that can be used across different modules of a large application.

   Questions:
   - How would you implement different log levels and allow dynamic changing of log levels at runtime?
   - What approach would you take to ensure that logging doesn't become a bottleneck in high-throughput scenarios?
   - How would you design the logging service to support multiple output destinations (console, file, network) simultaneously?

4. **Hardware Resource Manager**:
   Implement a Singleton to manage access to a limited hardware resource, such as a single printer or a specialized piece of laboratory equipment.

   Questions:
   - How would you implement a queuing system for print jobs or equipment usage requests?
   - What strategy would you use to handle timeouts and failures when interacting with the hardware?
   - How would you design the API to allow for future expansion to manage multiple similar resources?

5. **Game State Manager**:
   Create a Singleton to manage the global state of a video game, including player stats, game progress, and active quests.

   Questions:
   - How would you implement save/load functionality for the game state?
   - What approach would you take to ensure that the state remains consistent across different game modules?
   - How would you design the state manager to support multiple player profiles?

These scenarios and questions aim to explore the Singleton pattern in depth, considering real-world complexities and challenges that go beyond basic implementation. They encourage thinking about scalability, maintainability, and the broader system architecture when applying the Singleton pattern.

# Constraints

- The singleton must ensure that only one instance is created, even in multi-threaded environments.
- Lazy initialization should be supported to conserve resources when the singleton is not needed.
- The pattern should be implemented in a way that prevents the creation of additional instances through serialization/deserialization or reflection.
- Consider the impact on global state and potential for creating hidden dependencies in the codebase.
- The implementation should not hinder testability of the system.

# Notes

- Use the Singleton pattern judiciously, as it can introduce global state into an application, which can make the code harder to test and reason about.
- Consider alternatives like dependency injection, which can provide similar benefits with more flexibility and better testability.
- Be aware of potential issues with Singletons in distributed systems, where ensuring a true single instance across multiple nodes can be challenging.
- In languages with module systems (like Python), consider using module-level variables and functions instead of a Singleton class.
- Be cautious of using Singletons for resources that may need to scale horizontally in the future, as this pattern can make such scaling more difficult.
