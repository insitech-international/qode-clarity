# Version 1

LeetCode Version
Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s.

Example 1:
Input: s = "babad"
Output: "bab"
Explanation: "aba" is also a valid answer.

Example 2:
Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: "bb"

Example 3:
Input: s = "a"
Output: "a"

Data Compression Scenario:
In a cloud storage system, large amounts of text data need to be compressed efficiently to reduce storage costs. Since palindromes are symmetrical, identifying the longest palindromic substrings in text files can help optimize compression algorithms. By identifying and compressing recurring patterns like palindromes, the system can reduce the file size significantly without losing data integrity.

Bioinformatics Scenario:
In DNA sequence analysis, scientists often look for palindromic sequences that can form hairpin structures. These structures are important in various biological processes. Develop an algorithm to find the longest palindromic substring in a given DNA sequence to help identify potential hairpin structures.

Cryptography Scenario:
In a new encryption method, the key generation process involves finding the longest palindromic substring within a given string of characters. This substring is then used as part of the encryption key. Implement an algorithm to find this longest palindromic substring efficiently.

For all scenarios, implement a function that takes a string as input and returns the longest palindromic substring.

Example 1:
Input: str = "babad"
Output: "bab" or "aba"

Example 2:
Input: str = "cbbd"
Output: "bb"

Example 3:
Input: str = "a"
Output: "a"

# Constraints

1 <= str.length <= 10^4
str consists of only lowercase English letters.
