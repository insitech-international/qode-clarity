# Version 1
LeetCode Version
There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array points where points[i] = [xstart, xend] denotes a balloon whose horizontal diameter stretches between xstart and xend. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.

Arrows can be shot up directly vertically (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with xstart and xend is burst by an arrow shot at x if xstart <= x <= xend. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.

Given the array points, return the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.

Example 1:
Input: points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 6, bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 11, bursting the balloons [10,16] and [7,12].

Example 2:
Input: points = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]
Output: 4
Explanation: One arrow needs to be shot for each balloon for a total of 4 arrows.

# Version 2
Event Management Scenario:
You are in charge of managing events at a festival where balloons are used as decorations. Each balloon has a specific start and end position (interval) where it can be displayed. To optimize the use of resources, you need to determine the minimum number of arrows required to pop all the balloons, where each arrow can burst all balloons that it passes through. This helps ensure the festival area remains clear and organized.

Network Management Scenario:
In a computer network, you need to monitor traffic across different time intervals. Each interval represents a period of high network activity. To minimize the number of monitoring sessions, you want to find the minimum number of time points at which you can capture data that covers all high-activity periods.

Satellite Communication Scenario:
You're managing a satellite communication system. Each satellite has a specific time window during which it can transmit data to Earth. To optimize the use of ground stations, you need to determine the minimum number of reception windows needed to capture data from all satellites.

For all scenarios, create an algorithm that finds the minimum number of arrows (or monitoring points, or reception windows) needed to cover all given intervals.

Example 1:
Input: [[10,16], [2,8], [1,6], [7,12]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Two arrows are needed; one arrow can burst balloons at intervals [1,6] and [2,8], and another arrow can burst [10,16] and [7,12].

Example 2:
Input: [[1,2], [3,4], [5,6]]
Output: 3
Explanation: Each balloon is in a separate interval, so three arrows are needed, one for each balloon.
