# Version 1
LeetCode Version
You are given a string s. We want to partition the string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part.

Note that the partition is done so that after concatenating all the parts in order, the resultant string should be s.

Return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.

Example 1:
Input: s = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
Output: [9,7,8]
Explanation:
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits s into less parts.

Example 2:
Input: s = "eccbbbbdec"
Output: [10]

Project Management Scenario:
You are a project manager working on a content distribution strategy. Each task in your project is represented as a string where each character represents a unique task. The goal is to partition the tasks into the smallest number of sections such that each task is completed without interruption. A task can be interrupted if it appears in multiple sections.

Manufacturing Process Optimization Scenario:
In a manufacturing plant, you need to optimize the production line. Each product requires a series of operations, represented by characters in a string. To minimize setup times, you want to group operations so that each type of operation is performed continuously without interruption. Determine the optimal grouping of operations.

Software Development Sprint Planning Scenario:
You're planning sprints for a software development team. Each feature is represented by a character, and the string represents the sequence of features to be developed. To optimize the development process, you want to group features that have dependencies or shared resources. Create an algorithm to determine the optimal sprint divisions.

For all scenarios, create an algorithm that determines how many sections can be formed by partitioning the tasks, ensuring that each task appears in only one section at a time.

Example 1:
Input: "abac"
Output: 2
Explanation: The string can be partitioned into 'aba' and 'c', allowing all tasks to be completed in two sections.

Example 2:
Input: "eccbade"
Output: 3
Explanation: The string can be partitioned into 'ecc', 'b', and 'ade', ensuring all tasks are completed without overlap.

# Constraints
The input string will contain only lowercase English letters.
The maximum length of the input string is 1000.
